  <p id="xw20aab3b7"><i id="xw20aab3b7a">THE</i> following Notes were written in Virginia in
  the year 1781, and somewhat corrected and enlarged in the winter of 1782, in answer to

    id="xw20aab3b7b2" class="addEditorial">Jefferson is referring to François
    Barbé-Marbois (1745-1837), who was secretary to the French legation to the early
    United States. In 1780, Marbois gave a questionnaire to representatives of each of
    the thirteen states so that he could produce a report on the new nation. The
    questionnaire for Virginia was passed on to Jefferson, who took on the project of
    answering Marbois's queries; <i id="xw20aab3b7b2b1">Notes on the State of Virginia
    </i> is, ultimately, the product. In 1803, when Jefferson was President, Marbois
    negotiated the Louisiana Purchase with him.</span> then residing among us. The
  subjects are all treated imperfectly; some scarcely touched on. To apologize for this by
  developing the circumstances of the time and place of their composition, would be to
  open wounds which have already bled enough. To these circumstances some of their
  imperfections may with truth be ascribed; the great mass to the want of information and
  want of talents in the writer. He had a few copies printed, <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3b7b4" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3b7b4" class="addEditorial">In 1785, Jefferson had a private edition of
    200 copies of <i id="xw20aab3b7b4b1">Notes on the State of Virginia </i>printed in
    Paris; one of the copies of that printing has been digitized for this edition.
    Another copy was obtained by a French bookseller, who issued a translation of the
    work into French; unhappy with errors that had crept into the text, and worried that
    the book would now be translated back into English (with, very likely, more errors
    produced in that process), Jefferson approached the London publisher John Stockdale
    to issue a new, English edition. Page images of Jefferson&#8217;s own copy of the
    1787 London edition, which was extensively annotated and amended by him in later
    years, are also included in this edition.</span> which he gave among his friends:
  and a translation of them has been lately published in France, but with such alterations
  as the laws of the press in that country rendered necessary. They are now offered to the
  public in their original form and language. </p>

  <div id="xw20aab3c21" class="marginNote">Limits.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3c23"><i id="xw20aab3c23a">AN</i> exact description of the limits and Limits,
  boundaries of the state of Virginia ? </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c25">Virginia is bounded on the East by the Atlantic: on the North by a line
  of latitude, crossing the Eastern Shore through Watkins's Point, being about 37°. 57'.
  North latitude; from thence by a streight line to Cinquac, near the mouth of Patowmac;
  thence by the Patowmac, which is common to Virginia and Maryland, to the first fountain
  of its northern branch; thence by a meridian line, passing through that fountain till it
  intersects a line running East and West, in latitude 390°. 43', 42.4" which divides
  Maryland from Pennsylvania, and which was marked by Messrs. Mason and Dixon <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b1" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3c25b1" class="addEditorial">Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon had drawn
    the boundary between Maryland and Virginia in the 1760s, creating the famous
    "Mason-Dixon" line that would distinguish North from South by the time of the Civil
    War.</span>; thence by that line, and a continuation of it westwardly to the
  completion of five degrees of longitude from the eastern boundary of Pennsylvania, in
  the same latitude, and thence by a meridian line to the Ohio: On the West by the Ohio
  and Missisipi, to latitude 36°. 30'. North : and on the South by the line of latitude
  last- <span id="page-2" class="pagenum">[ 2 ]</span> mentioned. By admeasurements
  through nearly the whole of this last line, and supplying the unmeasured parts from good
  data, the Atlantic and Missisipi, are found in this latitude to be 758 miles distant,
  equal to 13°. 38'. of longitude, reckoning 55 miles and 3144 feet to the degree. This
  being our comprehension of longitude, that of our latitude, taken between this and Mason
  and Dixon's line, is 3°. 13'. 42.4". equal to 223.3 miles, supposing a degree of a great
  circle to be 69 m. 864 f. as computed by Cassini <img id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b5"
  class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span id="xw20aab3c25b5"
    class="addEditorial">Jacques Cassini (1677-1756) had calculated the precise distance
    of a degree of latitude.</span>. These boundaries include an area somewhat
  triangular, of 121525 square miles, whereof 79650 lie westward of the Allegany
  mountains, and 57034 westward of the meridian of the mouth of the Great Kanhaway <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b7" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3c25b7" class="addEditorial">Now more commonly known as the New
    River.</span>. This state is therefore one third larger than the islands of Great
  Britain and Ireland, which are reckoned at 88357 square miles. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c27">These limits result from, 1. The antient charters from the crown of
  England. 2. The grant of Maryland to the Lord Baltimore, and the subsequent
  determinations of the British court as to the extent of that grant. 3. The grant of
  Pennsylvania to William Penn, and a compact between the general assemblies of the
  commonwealths of Virginia and Pennsylvania as to the extent of that grant. 4. The grant
  of Carolina, and <span id="page-3" class="pagenum">[ 3 ]</span> actual location of its
  northern boundary, by consent of both parties. 5. The treaty of Paris of 1763. 6. The
  confirmation of the charters of the neighbouring states by the convention of Virginia at
  the time of constituting their commonwealth. 7. The cession made by Virginia to Congress
  of all the lands to which they had title on the North side of the Ohio. </p>

  <h4 id="xw20aab3c29">QUERY II.</h4>
  <div id="xw20aab3c31" class="marginNote">Rivers and Navigation.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3c33"><i id="xw20aab3c33a">A NOTICE</i> of its rivers, rivulets, and Rivers
  and navigation and how far they are navigable? </p> An inspection of a map of Virginia,
  will give a better idea of the geography of its rivers, than any description in writing.
  Their navigation may be imperfectly noted. <p id="xw20aab3c35">
  <i id="xw20aab3c35a">Roanoke</i>, so far as it lies within this state, is no where
  navigable, but for canoes, or light batteaux; and, even for these, in such detached
  parcels as to have prevented the inhabitants from availing themselves of it at all. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c37"><i id="xw20aab3c37a">James River</i>, and its waters, afford navigation
  as follows. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c39">The whole of Elizabeth River, the lowest of those which run into James
  River, is a harbour, and would contain upwards of 300 <span id="page-4" class="pagenum"
    >[ 4 ]</span> ships. The channel is from 150 to 200 fathom wide, and at common flood
  tide, affords 18 feet water to Norfolk. The Strafford, a 60 gun ship, went there,
  lightening herself to cross the bar at Sowell's point. The Fier Rodrigue, pierced for 64
  guns, and carrying 50, went there without lightening. Craney island, at the mouth of
  this river, commands its channel tolerably well. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c41"><i id="xw20aab3c41a">Nansemond River</i> is navigable to Sleepy hole,
  for vessels of 250 tons; to Suffolk, for those of 100 tons; and to Milner's, for those
  of 25. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c43"><i id="xw20aab3c43a">Pagan Creek</i> affords 8 or 10 feet water to
  Smithfeild, which admits vessels of 20 ton. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c45"><i id="xw20aab3c45a">Chickahominy</i> has at its mouth a bar, on which
  is only 12 feet water at common flood tide. Vessels passing that, may go 8 miles up the
  river; those of 10 feet draught may go four miles further, and those of six tons
  burthen, 20 miles further. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c47"><i id="xw20aab3c47a">Appamattox</i> may be navigated as far as
  Broadways, by any vessel which has crossed Harrison's bar in James river; it keeps 8 or
  9 feet water a mile or two higher up to Fisher's bar, and 4 feet on that and upwards to
  Petersburgh, where all navigation ceases. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c49"><i id="xw20aab3c49a">James River</i> itself affords harbour for vessels
  of any size in Hampton Road, but not in safety through the whole winter; and <span
    id="page-5" class="pagenum">[ 5 ]</span> there is navigable water for them as far as
  Mulberry island. A 40 gun ship goes to James town, and, lightening herself, may pass to
  Harrison's bar, on which there is only 15 feet water. Vessels of 250 tons may go to
  Warwick; those of 125 go to Rocket's, a mile below Richmond; from thence is about 7 feet
  water to Richmond; and about the center of the town, four feet and a half, where the
  navigation is interrupted by falls, which in a course of six miles, descend about 80
  feet perpendicular: above these it is resumed in canoes and batteaux, and is prosecuted
  safely and advantageously to within 10 miles of the Blue ridge; and even through the
  Blue ridge a ton weight has been brought; and the expence would not be great, when
  compared with its object, to open a tolerable navigation up Jackson's river and
  Carpenter's creek, to within 25 miles of Howard's creek of Green briar, both of which
  have then water enough to float vessels into the Great Kanhaway. In some future state of
  population, I think it possible, that its navigation may also be made to interlock with
  that of the Patowmac, and through that to communicate by a short portage with the Ohio.
  It is to be noted, that this river is called in the maps <i id="xw20aab3c49b4">James
    River</i>, only to its confluence with the Rivanna; thence to the <span id="page-6"
    class="pagenum">[ 6 ]</span> Blue ridge it is called the Fluvanna; and thence to its
  source, Jackson's river. But in common speech, it is called James river to its source. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c51">The <i id="xw20aab3c51b1">Rivanna</i>, a branch of James river, is
  navigable for canoes and batteaux to its intersection with the South West mountains,
  which is about 22 miles; and may easily be opened to navigation through those mountains
  to its fork above Charlottesville. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c53"><i id="xw20aab3c53a">York River</i>, at York town, affords the best
  harbour in the state for vessels of the largest size. The river there narrows to the
  width of a mile, and is contained within very high banks, close under which the vessels
  may ride. It holds 4 fathom water at high tide for 25 miles above York to the mouth of
  Poropotank, where the river is a mile and a half wide, and the channel only 75 fathom,
  and passing under a high bank. At the confluence of <i id="xw20aab3c53b2">Pamunkey</i>
  and <i id="xw20aab3c53b4">Mattapony</i>, it is reduced to 3 fathom depth, which
  continues up Pamunkey to Cumberland, where the width is 100 yards, and up Mattapony to
  within two miles of Frazer's ferry, where it becomes 2½ fathom deep, and holds that
  about five miles. Pamunkey is then capable of navigation for loaded flats to Brockman's
  bridge, 50 miles above Hanover town, <span id="page-7" class="pagenum">[ 7 ]</span> and
  Mattapony to Downer's bridge, 70 miles above its mouth. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c55"><i id="xw20aab3c55a">Piankatank</i>, the little rivers making out of <i
    id="xw20aab3c55b2">Mobjack bay</i> and those of the <i id="xw20aab3c55b4">Eastern
    Shore</i>, receive only very small vessels, and these can but enter them. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c57"><i id="xw20aab3c57a">Rappahanock</i> affords 4 fathom water to Hobb's
  hole, and 2 fathom from thence to Fredericksburg. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c59"><i id="xw20aab3c59a">Patowmac</i> is 7½ miles wide at the mouth ; 4½ at
  Nomony bay; 3 at Aquia; 1½ at Hallooing point; 1¼ at Alexandria. Its soundings are, 7
  fathom at the mouth; 5 at St. George's island; 4½ at Lower Matchodic ; 3 at Swan's
  point, and thence up to Alexandria; thence 10 feet water to the falls, which are 13
  miles above Alexandria. These falls are 15 miles in length, and of very great descent,
  and the navigation above them for batteaux and canoes, is so much interrupted as to be
  little used. It is, however, used in a small degree up the Cohongoronta branch as far as
  Fort Cumberland, which was at the mouth of Wills's creek: and is capable, at no great
  expence, of being rendered very practicable. The Shenandoah branch interlocks with James
  river about the Blue ridge, and may perhaps in future be opened. </p>
  <span id="page-8" class="pagenum">[ 8 ]</span>
  <p id="xw20aab3c63">The <i id="xw20aab3c63b1">Missisipi</i> will be one of the principal
  channels of future commerce for the country westward of the Alleghaney. From the mouth
  of this river to where it receives the Ohio, is 1000 miles by water, but only 500 by
  land, passing through the Chickasaw country. From the mouth of the Ohio to that of the
  Missouri, is 230 miles by water, and 140 by land. From thence to the mouth of the
  Illinois river, is about 25 miles. The Missisipi, below the mouth of the Missouri, is
  always muddy, and abounding with sand bars, which frequently change their places.
  However, it carries 15 feet water to the mouth of the Ohio, to which place it is from
  one and a half to two miles wide, and thence to Kaskaskia from one mile to a mile and a
  quarter wide. Its current is so rapid, that it never can be stemmed by the force of the
  wind alone, acting on sails. Any vessel, however, navigated with oars, may come up at
  any time, and receive much aid from the wind. A batteaux passes from the mouth of Ohio
  to the mouth of Missisipi in three weeks, and is from two to three months getting up
  again. During its floods, which are periodical as those of the Nile, the largest vessels
  may pass down it, if their steerage can be ensured. These floods begin in April, and the
  river returns into its banks <span id="page-9" class="pagenum">[ 9 ]</span> early in
  August. The inundation extends further on the western than eastern side, covering the
  lands in some places for 50 miles from its banks. Above the mouth of the Missouri, it
  becomes much such a river as the Ohio, like it clear; and gentle in its current, not
  quite so wide, the period of its floods nearly the same, but not rising to so great a
  height. The streets of the village at Cohoes are not more than 10 feet above the
  ordinary level of the water, and yet were never overflowed. Its bed deepens every year.
  Cohoes, in the memory of many people now living, was insulated by every flood of the
  river. What was the Eastern channel has now become a lake, 9 miles in length and one in
  width, into which the river at this day never flows. This river yields turtle of a
  peculiar kind, perch, trout, gar, pike, mullets, herrings, carp, spatula fish <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3c63b5" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3c63b5" class="addEditorial"><i id="xw20aab3c63b5a">Atractosteus
      spatula</i>, now commonly known as the Alligator Gar.</span> of 50 lb. weight,
  cat fish of an hundred pounds weight, buffalo fish, <span id="xw20aab3c63b7"
    class="addEditorial"><i id="xw20aab3c63b7a">Ictiobus</i>, a common freshwater
    fish.</span> and sturgeon. Alligators or crocodiles have been seen as high up as the
  Acansas.<span id="xw20aab3c63b9" class="addEditorial">Arkansas.</span> It also
  abounds in herons, cranes, ducks, brant, geese, and swans. Its passage is commanded by a
  fort established by this state, five miles below the mouth of Ohio, and ten miles above
  the Carolina boundary. </p>
  <span id="page-10" class="pagenum">[ 10 ]</span>
  <p id="xw20aab3c67">The Missouri, since the treaty of Paris, the Illinois and Northern
  branches of the Ohio since the cession to Congress, are no longer within our limits. Yet
  having been so heretofore, and still opening to us channels of extensive communication
  with the western and north-western country, they shall be noted in their order. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c69">The <i id="xw20aab3c69b1">Missouri</i> is, in fact, the principal river,
  contributing more to the common stream than does the Missisipi, even after its junction
  with the Illinois. It is remarkably cold, muddy and rapid. Its overflowings are
  considerable. They happen during the months of June and July. Their commencement being
  so much later than those of the Missisipi, would induce a belief that the sources of the
  Missouri are northward of those of the Missisipi, unless we suppose that the cold
  increases again with the ascent of the land from the Missisipi westwardly. That this
  ascent is great, is proved by the rapidity of the river. Six miles above the mouth it is
  brought within the compass of a quarter of a mile's width: yet the Spanish Merchants at
  Pancore <img id="editorial-xw20aab3c69b3" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png"
  /><span id="xw20aab3c69b3" class="addEditorial">Pancore or Pain Court is now a part
    of the city of St. Louis, Missouri.</span>, or St. Louis, say they go two thousand
  miles up it. It heads far westward of the Rio Norte, or North River <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3c69b5" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3c69b5" class="addEditorial">Now known as the Rio Grande.</span>. There
  is, in the villages of Kaskaskia, Cohoes and St. Vincennes, no inconsiderable quantity
  of <span id="page-11" class="pagenum">[ 11 ]</span> plate, said to have been plundered
  during the last war by the Indians from the churches and private houses of Santa Fé, on
  the North River, and brought to these villages for sale. From the mouth of Ohio to Santa
  Fé are forty days journey, or about 1000 miles. What is the shortest distance between
  the navigable waters of the Missouri, and those of the North River, or how far this is
  navigable above Santa Fé, I could never learn. From Santa Fé to its mouth in the Gulph
  of Mexico is about 1200 miles. The road from New Orleans to Mexico crosses this river at
  the post of Rio Norte, 800 miles below Santa Fé: and from this post to New Orleans is
  about 1200 miles; thus making 2000 miles between Santa Fé and New Orleans, passing down
  the North river, Red river and Missisipi; whereas it is 2230 through the Missouri and
  Missisipi. From the same post of Rio Norte, passing near the mines of La Sierra and
  Laiguana, which are between the North river and the river Salina to Sartilla, is 375
  miles; and from thence, passing the mines of Charcas, Zaccatecas and Potosi, to the city
  of Mexico is 375 miles; in all, 1550 miles from Santa Fé to the city of Mexico. From New
  Orleans to the city of Mexico is about 1950 miles: the roads, after setting out from the
  Red river, near <span id="page-12" class="pagenum">[ 12 ]</span> Natchitoches, keeping
  generally parallel with the coast, and about two hundred miles from it, till it enters
  the city of Mexico. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c71">The <i id="xw20aab3c71b1">Illinois</i> is a fine river, clear, gentle,
  and without rapids; insomuch that it is navigable for batteaux <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3c71b3" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3c71b3" class="addEditorial">A kind of flat-bottomed boat, widely used in
    this period for navigating rivers.</span> to its source. From thence is a portage of
  two miles only to the Chickago, which affords a batteau navigation of 16 miles to its
  entrance into lake Michigan. The Illinois, about 10 miles above its mouth, is 300 yards
  wide. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c73">The <i id="xw20aab3c73b1">Kaskaskia</i> is 100 yards wide at its
  entrance into the Missisipi, and preserves that breadth to the Buffalo plains, 70 miles
  above. So far also it is navigable for loaded batteaux, and perhaps much further. It is
  not rapid. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c75">The <i id="xw20aab3c75b1">Ohio</i> is the most beautiful river on earth.

  <p id="xw20aab3c97">In common winter and spring tides it affords 15 feet water to
  Louisville, 10 feet to La Tarte's rapids, 40 miles above the mouth of the great
  Kanhaway, and a sufficiency at all times for light batteaux and canoes to Fort Pitt. The
  rapids are in latitude 38°. 8'. The inundations of this river begin about the last of
  March, and subside in July. During these a first rate man of war may be carried from
  Louisville to New Orleans, if <span id="page-14" class="pagenum">[ 14 ]</span> the
  sudden turns of the river and the strength of its current will admit a safe steerage.
  The rapids at Louisville descend about 30 feet in a length of a mile and a half. The bed
  of the river there is a solid rock, and is divided by an island into two branches, the
  southern of which is about 200 yards wide, and is dry four months in the year. The bed
  of the northern branch is worn into channels by the constant course of the water, and
  attrition of the pebble stones carried on with that, so as to be passable for batteaux
  through the greater part of the year. Yet it is thought that the southern arm may be the
  most easily opened for constant navigation. The rise of the waters in these rapids does
  not exceed 10 or 12 feet. A part of this island is so high as to have been never
  overflowed, and to command the settlement at Louisville, which is opposite to it. The
  fort, however, is situated at the head of the falls. The ground on the South side rises
  very gradually. </p>

  This river crosses the southern boundary of Virginia, 58 miles from the Missisipi. Its
  current is moderate. It is navigable for loaded boats of any burthen to the <span
    id="page-15" class="pagenum">[ 15 ]</span> Muscleshoals, where the river passes
  through the Cumberland mountain. These shoals are 6 or 8 miles long, passable downwards
  for loaded canoes, but not upwards, unless there be a swell in the river. Above these
  the navigation for loaded canoes and batteaux continues to the Long island. This river
  has its inundations also. Above the Chickamogga towns is a whirlpool called the
  Sucking-pot, which takes in trunks of trees or boats, and throws them out again half a
  mile below. It is avoided by keeping very close to the bank, on the South side. There
  are but a few miles portage between a branch of this river and the navigable waters of
  the river Mobile, which runs into the gulph of Mexico. </p>

  miles from the same river, a little above the entrance of Obey's river into the
  Cumberland. Its clear fork crosses the same boundary about 300 miles from the Missisipi.
  Cumberland is a very gentle stream, navigable for loaded batteaux 800 miles, without
  interruption; then intervene some rapids of 15 miles in length, after which it is again
  navigable 70 miles upwards, which brings you within 10 miles of <span id="page-16"

  mouth, in a direct line. Within this space there are two small rapids, which give very
  little obstruction to the navigation. It is 400 yards wide at the mouth, and navigable
  30 leagues upwards for canoes and small boats. From the mouth of Maple river to that of
  Eel river is about 80 miles in a direct line, the river continuing navigable, and from
  one to two hundred yards in width. The Eel river is 150 yards wide, and affords at all
  times navigation for periaguas, to within 18 miles of the Miami of the lake. The Wabash,
  from the mouth of Eel river to Little river, a distance of 50 miles direct, is
  interrupted with frequent rapids and shoals, which obstruct the navigation, except in a
  swell. Little river affords navigation during a swell to within 3 miles of the Miami,
  which thence affords a similar navigation into lake Erié, 100 miles distant in a direct
  line. The Wabash overflows periodically in correspondence with the Ohio, and in some
  places two leagues from its banks. </p>

  rapids will admit a navigation, but at an expence to which it will require ages to
  render its inhabitants equal. The great obstacles begin at what are called the great
  falls, 90 miles above the mouth, below which are only five or six rapids, and these
  passable, with some difficulty, even at low water. From the falls to the mouth of

  navigation good for boats. Thence the width is about 200 yards to the western fork, 50
  miles higher, and the navigation frequently interrupted by rapids; which however with a
  swell of two or three feet become very passable for boats. It then admits light boats,
  except in dry seasons, 65 miles further to the head of Tygarts valley, presenting only
  some small rapids and falls of one or two feet perpendicular, and lessening in its width
  to 20 <span id="page-20" class="pagenum">[ 20 ]</span> yards. The <i id="xw20aab3d133b5"

  the Little Kanhaway, and will admit a good waggon road to it. The <i id="xw20aab3d133b7"
    >Yohoganey</i> is the principal branch of this river. It passes through the Laurel
  mountain, about 30 miles from its mouth; is so far from 300 to 150 yards wide, and the
  navigation much obstructed in dry weather by rapids and shoals. In its passage through
  the mountain it makes very great falls, admitting no navigation for ten miles to the
  Turkey foot. Thence to the great crossing, about 20 miles, it is again navigable, except
  in dry seasons, and at this place is 200 yards wide. The sources of this river are
  divided from those of the Patowmac by the Alleghaney mountain. From the falls, where it
  intersects the Laurel mountain, to Fort Cumberland, the head of the navigation on the
  Patowmac, is 40 miles of very mountainous road. Wills's creek, at the mouth of which was
  Fort Cumberland, is 30 or 40 yards wide, but affords no navigation as yet. <i
    id="xw20aab3d133b9">Cheat</i> river, another considerable branch of the Monongahela,
  is 200 yards wide at its mouth, and 100 yards at the Dunkard's settlement, 50 miles
  higher. It is navigable for boats, except in dry seasons. The boundary between Virginia
  and <span id="page-21" class="pagenum">[ 21 ]</span> Pennsylvania crosses it about three
  or four miles above its mouth. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d135">The <i id="xw20aab3d135b1">Alleghaney</i> river, with a slight swell,
  affords navigation for light batteaux to Venango, at the mouth of French creek, where it
  is 200 yards wide; and it is practised even to Le Boeuf, from whence there is a portage
  of 15 miles to Presque Isle on Lake Erié. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d137">The country watered by the Missisipi and its eastern branches,
  constitutes five-eighths of the United States, two of which five-eighths are occupied by
  the Ohio and its waters; the residuary streams which run into the Gulph of Mexico, the
  Atlantic, and the St. Laurence water, the remaining three-eighths. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d139">Before we quit the subject of the western waters, we will take a view
  of their principal connections with the Atlantic. These are three; the Hudson's river,
  the Patowmac, and the Missisipi itself. Down the last will pass all heavy commodities.
  But the navigation through the Gulph of Mexico is so dangerous, and that up the
  Missisipi so difficult and tedious, that it is thought probable that European
  merchandize will not return through that channel. It is most likely that flour, timber,
  and other heavy articles will be floated on rafts, which will themselves be an article
  for sale as well as their loading, the <span id="page-22" class="pagenum">[ 22 ]</span>
  navigators returning by land or in light batteaux. There will therefore be a competition
  between the Hudson and Patowmac rivers for the residue of the commerce of all the
  country westward of Lake Erié, on the waters of the lakes, of the Ohio, and upper parts
  of the Missisipi. To go to New-York, that part of the trade which comes from the lakes
  or their waters must first be brought into Lake Erié. Between Lake Superior and its
  waters and Huron are the rapids of St. Mary, which will permit boats to pass, but not
  larger vessels. Lakes Huron and Michigan afford communication with Lake Erié by vessels
  of 8 feet draught. That part of the trade which comes from the waters of the Missisipi
  must pass from them through some portage into the waters of the lakes. The portage from
  the Illinois river into a water of Michigan is of one mile only. From the Wabash, Miami,
  Muskingum, or Alleghaney, are portages into the waters of Lake Erié, of from one to
  fifteen miles. When the commodities are brought into, and have passed through Lake Erié,
  there is between that and Ontario an interruption by the falls of Niagara, where the
  portage is of 8 miles; and between Ontario and the Hudson's river are portages at the
  falls of Onondago, a little above Oswego, of a quarter of a mile; from <span
    id="page-23" class="pagenum">[ 23 ]</span> Wood creek to the Mohawks river two
  miles; at the little falls of the Mohawks river half a mile, and from Schenectady to
  Albany 16 miles. Besides the increase of expence occasioned by frequent change of
  carriage, there is an increased risk of pillage produced by committing merchandize to a
  greater number of hands successively. The Patowmac offers itself under the following
  circumstances. For the trade of the lakes and their waters westward of Lake Erié, when
  it shall have entered that lake, it must coast along its southern shore, on account of
  the number and excellence of its harbours, the northern, though shortest, having few
  harbours, and these unsafe. Having reached Cayahoga, to proceed on to New-York it will
  have 825 miles and five portages: whereas it is but 425 miles to Alexandria, its
  emporium on the Patowmac, if it turns into the Cayahoga, and passes through that,
  Bigbeaver, Ohio, Yohoganey, (or Monongalia and Cheat) and Patowmac, and there are but
  two portages; the first of which between Cayahoga and Beaver may be removed by uniting
  the sources of these waters, which are lakes in the neighbourhood of each other, and in
  a champaign country; the other from the waters of Ohio to Patowmac will be from 15 to 40
  miles, according to the trouble which shall be taken to approach the two <span
    id="page-24" class="pagenum">[ 24 ]</span> navigations. For the trade of the Ohio,
  or that which shall come into it from its own waters or the Missisipi, it is nearer
  through the Patowmac to Alexandria than to New-York by 580 miles, and it is interrupted
  by one portage only. There is another circumstance of difference too. The lakes
  themselves never freeze, but the communications between them freeze, and the Hudson's
  river is itself shut up by the ice three months in the year; whereas the channel to the
  Chesapeak leads directly into a warmer climate. The southern parts of it very rarely
  freeze at all, and whenever the northern do, it is so near the sources of the rivers,
  that the frequent floods to which they are there liable break up the ice immediately, so
  that vessels may pass through the whole winter, subject only to accidental and short
  delays. Add to all this, that in case of a war with our neighbours the Anglo-Americans
  or the Indians, the route to New-York becomes a frontier through almost its whole
  length, and all commerce through it ceases from that moment.&#8212;But the channel to
  New-York is already known to practice; whereas the upper waters of the Ohio and the
  Patowmac, and the great falls of the latter, are yet to be cleared of their fixed
  obstructions (I). </p>

  philosophical view of them than is to be found in any other work. It is worthy notice,
  that our mountains are not solitary and scattered confusedly over the face of the
  country; but that they commence at about 150 miles from the sea-coast, are disposed in
  ridges one behind another, running nearly parallel with the sea-coast, though rather
  approaching it as they advance north-eastwardly. To the south-west, as the tract of
  country between the sea-coast and the Mississipi becomes narrower, the mountains
  converge into a single <span id="page-26" class="pagenum">[ 26 ]</span> ridge, which, as
  it approaches the Gulph of Mexico, subsides into plain country, and gives rise to some
  of the waters of that Gulph, and particularly to a river called the Apalachicola,
  probably from the Apalachies, an Indian nation formerly residing on it. Hence the
  mountains giving rise to that river, and seen from its various parts, were called the
  Apalachian mountains, being in fact the end or termination only of the great ridges
  passing through the continent. European geographers however extended the name
  northwardly as far as the mountains extended; some giving it, after their separation
  into different ridges, to the Blue ridge, others to the North mountain, others to the
  Alleghaney, others to the Laurel ridge, as may be seen in their different maps. But the
  fact I believe is, that none of these ridges were ever known by that name to the
  inhabitants, either native or emigrant, but as they saw them so called in European maps.
  In the same direction generally are the veins of lime-stone, coal and other minerals
  hitherto discovered: and so range the falls of our great rivers. But the courses of the
  great rivers are at right angles with these. James and Patowmac penetrate through all
  the ridges of mountains eastward of the Alleghaney; that is broken by no watercourse.

  through the Blue ridge is perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in nature. You stand
  on a very high point of land. On your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along
  the foot of the mountain an hundred miles to seek a vent. On your left approaches the
  Patowmac, in quest of a passage also. In the moment of their junction they rush together
  against the mountain, rend it asunder, and pass off to the sea. The first glance of this
  scene hurries our senses into the opinion, that this earth has been created in time,
  that the mountains were formed first, that the rivers began to flow afterwards, that in
  this place particularly they have been dammed up by the Blue ridge of mountains, and
  have formed an ocean which filled the whole valley; that continuing to rise they have at

  base. The piles of rock on each hand, but particularly on the Shenandoah, the evident
  marks of their disrupture and avulsion from their beds by the most powerful agents of
  nature, corroborate the impression. But the distant finishing which nature has given to
  the <span id="page-28" class="pagenum">[ 28 ]</span> picture is of a very different
  character. It is a true contrast to the fore-ground. It is as placid and delightful, as
  that is wild and tremendous. For the mountain being cloven asunder, she presents to your
  eye, through the cleft, a small catch of smooth blue horizon, at an infinite distance in
  the plain country, inviting you, as it were, from the riot and tumult roaring around, to
  pass through the breach and participate of the calm below. Here the eye ultimately
  composes itself; and that way too the road happens actually to lead. You cross the
  Patowmac above the junction, pass along its side through the base of the mountain for
  three miles, its terrible precipices hanging in fragments over you, and within about 20
  miles reach Frederic town and the fine country round that. This scene is worth a voyage
  across the Atlantic. Yet here, as in the neighbourhood of the natural bridge <img

  America, nor one third of the height which would be necessary in our latitude to

  rising in the warm spring mountains about twenty miles South West of the warm spring,
  and flowing into that valley. About three quarters of a mile from its source, it falls
  over a rock 200 feet into the valley below. The sheet of water is broken in its breadth
  by the rock in two or three places, but not at all in its height. Between the sheet and
  rock, at the bottom, you may walk across dry. This Cataract will bear no comparison with
  that of Niagara, as to the quantity of water composing it; the sheet being only 12 or 15
  feet wide above, and somewhat more spread below; but it is half as high again, the

  <div id="xw20aab3d165" class="marginNote">Madison's cave.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d167">In the lime-stone country, there are many caverns of very considerable
  extent. The most noted is called Madison's Cave, and is on the North side of the Blue
  ridge, near the intersection of the Rockingham and Augusta line with the South fork of
  the southern river of Shenandoah. It is in a hill of about 200 feet perpendicular
  height, the ascent of which, on one side, is so steep, that you may pitch a biscuit from
  its summit into the river which washes its base. The entrance of the cave is, in this
  side, about two thirds of the way up. It extends into the earth about 300 feet,
  branching into subordinate caverns, sometimes ascending a little, but more generally
  descending, and at length terminates, in two different places, at basons of water of
  unknown extent, and which I should judge to be nearly on a level with the water of the
  river; however, I do not think they are formed by refluent water from that, because they
  are never turbid; because they do not rise and fall in correspondence with that in times
  of flood, or of drought; and because the water is always cool. It is probably one of the
  many reservoirs with which the interior parts of the earth are supposed to <span

  abound, and which yield supplies to the fountains of water, distinguished from others
  only by its being accessible. The vault of this cave is of solid lime-stone, from 20 to
  40 or 50 feet high, through which water is continually percolating. This, trickling down
  the sides of the cave, has incrusted them over in the form of elegant drapery; and
  dripping from the top of the vault generates on that, and on the base below, stalactites
  of a conical form, some of which have met and formed massive columns. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d169">Another of these caves is near the North mountain, in the county of
  Frederick, on the lands of Mr. Zane. The entrance into this is on the top of an
  extensive ridge. You descend 30 or 40 feet, as into a well, from whence the cave then
  extends, nearly horizontally, 400 feet into the earth, preserving a breadth of from 20
  to 50 feet, and a height of from 5 to 12 feet. After entering this cave a few feet, the
  mercury, which in the open air was at 50°. rose to 57°. of Farenheit's thermometer,
  answering to 11°. of Reaumur's, and it continued at that to the remotest parts of the
  cave. The uniform temperature of the cellars of the observatory of Paris, which are 90
  feet deep, and of all subterranean cavities of any depth, where no chymical agents may
  be supposed <span id="page-34" class="pagenum">[ 34 ]</span> to produce a factitious
  heat, has been found to be 10°. of Reamur, equal to 54½°. of Farenheit. The temperature
  of the cave above-mentioned so nearly corresponds with this, that the difference may be
  ascribed to a difference of instruments. </p>

  <p id="xw20aab3d173">At the Panther gap, in the ridge which divides the waters of the Cow

  is in the side of a hill, is of about 100 feet diameter, and emits constantly a current
  of air of such force, as to keep the weeds prostrate to the distance of twenty yards
  before it. This current is strongest in dry frosty weather, and in long spells of rain
  weakest. Regular inspirations and expirations of air, by caverns and fissures, have been
  probably enough accounted for, by supposing them combined with intermitting fountains;
  as they must of course inhale air while their reservoirs are emptying themselves, and
  again emit it while they are filling. But a constant issue of air, only varying in its
  force as the weather is drier or damper, will require a new hypothesis. There is another
  blowing cave in the Cumberland mountain, about a mile from where it crosses the Carolina
  line. All we know of this is, that it is not constant, and that a fountain of water
  issues from it. </p>

  Nature's works, though not comprehended under the present head, must not be
  pretermitted. It is on the ascent of a hill, which seems to have been cloven through its
  length by some great convulsion. The fissure, just at the bridge, is, by some
  admeasurements, 270 feet deep, by others only 205. It is about 45 feet wide at the
  bottom, and 90 feet at the top; this of course determines the length of the bridge, and
  its height from the water. Its breadth in the middle, is about 60 feet, but more at the
  ends, and the thickness of the mass at the summit of the arch, about 40 feet. A part of
  this thickness is constituted by a coat of earth, which gives growth to many large
  trees. The residue, with the hill on both sides, is one solid rock of limestone. The
  arch approaches the Semi-elliptical form; but the larger axis of the ellipsis, which
  would be the cord of the arch, is many times longer than the transverse. Though the
  sides of this bridge are provided in some parts with a parapet of fixed rocks, yet few
  men have resolution to walk to them and look over into the abyss. You involuntarily fall
  on your hands and feet, creep to the parapet and peep over it. Looking down from this
  height about a minute, gave me a violent head ach. If the view from the top be <span

  indescribable! The fissure continuing narrow, deep, and straight for a considerable
  distance above and below the bridge, opens a short but very pleasing view of the North
  mountain on one side, and Blue ridge on the other, at the distance each of them of about
  five miles. This bridge is in the county of Rock bridge, to which it has given name, and
  affords a public and commodious passage over a valley which cannot be crossed elsewhere
  for a considerable distance. The stream passing under it is called Cedar creek. It is a
  water of James river, and sufficient in the driest seasons to turn a grist-mill, though
  its fountain is not more than two miles above*. </p>

    Don Ulloa inclines to the opinion, that this channel has been effected by the wearing of
    the water which runs through it, rather than that the mountain should have been broken
    open by any convulsion of nature. But if it had been worn by the running of water, would
    not the rocks which form the sides, have been worn plane? or if, meeting in some parts
    with veins of harder stone, the water had left prominences on the one side, would not
    the same cause have sometimes, or perfectlyhaps generally, occasioned prominences on the other
    side also? Yet Don Ulloa tells us, that on the other side there are always corresponding
    cavities, and that these tally with the prominences so perfectly, that, were the two
    sides to come together, they would fit in all their indentures, without leaving any
    void. I think that this does not resemble the effect of running water, but looks rather
    as if the two sides had parted asunder. The sides of the break, over which is the

  &#8232;weight, which yielded seventeen penny-weight of gold, of extraordinary ductility.
  &#8232;This ore was found on the North side of &#8232;Rappahanoc, about four miles below

  <p id="xw20aab3d222">On the Great Kanhaway, opposite to the mouth of Cripple creek, and
  about twenty-five miles from our southern boundary, in the county of Montgomery, are
  mines of lead. The metal is mixed, sometimes with earth, and sometimes with rock, which
  requires the force of gunpowder to open it; and is accompanied with a portion of silver,
  too small to be worth separation under any process hitherto attempted there. The
  proportion yielded is from 50 to 80 lb. of pure metal from 100 lb. of washed ore. The
  most common is that of 60 to the 100 lb. The veins are at sometimes most flattering; at
  others they disappear suddenly and totally. They enter the side of the hill, and proceed

    This break has the advantage of the one described by Don Ulloa in its finest

  <span id="page-39" class="pagenum">[ 39 ]</span> horizontally. Two of them are wrought
  at present by the public, the best of which is 100 yards under the hill. These would
  employ about 50 labourers to advantage. We have not, however, more than 30 generally,
  and these cultivate their own corn. They have produced 60 tons of lead in the year; but
  the general quantity is from 20 to 25 tons. The present furnace is a mile from the
  ore-bank, and on the opposite side of the river. The ore is first waggoned to the river,
  a quarter of a mile, then laden on board of canoes and carried across the river, which
  is there about 200 yards wide, and then again taken into waggons and carried to the
  furnace. This mode was originally adopted, that they might avail themselves of a good
  situation on a creek, for a pounding mill: but it would be easy to have the furnace and
  pounding mill on the same side of the river, which would yield water, without any dam,
  by a canal of about half a mile in length. From the furnace the lead is transported 130
  miles along a good road, leading through the peaks of Otter to Lynch's ferry, or
  Winston's, on James river, from whence it is carried by water about the same distance to
  Westham. This land carriage may be greatly shortened, by delivering the lead on James
  river, above the blue ridge, from <span id="page-40" class="pagenum">[ 40 ]</span>
  whence a ton weight has been brought on two canoes. The Great Kanhaway has considerable
  falls in the neighbourhood of the mines. About seven miles below are three falls, of
  three or four feet perpendicular each; and three miles above is a rapid of three miles
  continuance, which has been compared in its descent to the great fall of James river.
  Yet it is the opinion, that they may be laid open for useful navigation, so as to reduce
  very much the portage between the Kanhaway and James river. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d224">A valuable lead mine is said to have been lately discovered in
  Cumberland, below the mouth of Red river. The greatest, however, known in the western
  country, are on the Missisipi, extending from the mouth of Rock river 150 miles upwards.
  These are not wrought, the lead used in that country being from the banks on the Spanish

  <p id="xw20aab3d234">The mines of iron worked at present are Callaway's, Ross's, and
  Ballendine's, on the South side of James river; Old's on the North side, in Albemarle;
  Miller's in Augusta, and Zane's in Frederic. These two last are in the valley between
  the Blue ridge and North mountain. Callaway's, Ross's, Millar's, and Zane's, make about
  150 tons of bar iron each, in the year. Ross's makes also about 1600 tons of pig iron
  annually; Ballendine's 1000; Callaway's, Millar's, and Zane's, about 600 each. Besides
  these, a forge of Mr. Hunter's, at Fredericksburgh, makes about 300 tons a year of bar
  iron, from pigs imported from Maryland ; and Taylor's forge on Neapsco of Patowmac,
  works in the same way, but to what extent I am not informed. The indications of iron in
  other places are numerous, and dispersed through all the middle country. The toughness
  of the cast iron of Ross's and Zane's furnaces is very remarkable. Pots and other
  utensils, cast thinner than usual, of this iron, may be fasely thrown into, or out of
  the waggons in which they are transported. Salt-pans made of the same, and no longer

  between the Cumberland and Barren rivers, between Cumberland and Tannissee, on Reedy
  creek, near the Long island, and on Chesnut creek, a branch of the Great Kanhaway, near
  where it crosses the Carolina line. What are called the iron banks, on the Missisipi,
  are believed, by a good judge, to have no iron in them. In general, from what is

  <div id="xw20aab3d242" class="marginNote">Pit coal.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d244">The country on James river, from 15 to 20 miles above Richmond, and for
  several miles northward and southward, is replete with mineral coal of a very excellent
  quality. Being in the hands of many proprietors, pits have been opened, and before the
  interruption of our commerce were worked to an extent equal to the demand. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d246">In the western country coal is known to be in so many places, as to
  have induced an opinion, that the whole tract between the Laurel mountain, Missisipi,
  and Ohio, yields coal. It is also known in many places on <span id="page-43"
    class="pagenum">[ 43 ]</span> the North side of the Ohio. The coal at Pittsburg is
  of very superior quality. A bed of it at that place has been a-fire since the year 1765.
  Another coal-hill on the Pikerun of Monongahela has been a-fire ten years; yet it has
  burnt away about twenty yards only. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d248" class="marginNote">Precious stones.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d250">I have known one instance of an Emerald found in this country.
  Amethysts have been frequent, and chrystals common; yet not in such numbers any of them
  as to be worth seeking. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d252" class="marginNote">Marble.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d254">There is very good marble, and in very great abundance, on James river,
  at the mouth of Rockfish. The samples I have seen, were some of them of a white as pure
  as one might expect to find on the surface of the earth: but most of them were
  variegated with red, blue, and purple. None of it has been ever worked. It forms a very
  large precipice, which hangs over a navigable part of the river. It is said there is
  marble at Kentucky. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d256" class="marginNote">Limestone.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d258">But one vein of lime-stone is known below the Blue ridge. Its first
  appearance, in our country, is in Prince William, two miles below the Pignut ridge of
  mountains; thence it passes on nearly parallel with that, and crosses the Rivanna about
  five miles below it, where it is called the South-west ridge. It then crosses Hardware,
  above the mouth <span id="page-44" class="pagenum">[ 44 ]</span> of Hudson's creek,
  James river at the mouth of Rockfish, at the marble quarry before spoken of, probably
  runs up that river to where it appears again at Ross's iron-works, and so passes off
  south-westwardly by Flat creek of Otter river. It is never more than one hundred yards
  wide. From the Blue ridge westwardly the whole country seems to be founded on a rock of
  lime-stone, besides infinite quantities on the surface, both loose and fixed. This is
  cut into beds, which range, as the mountains and sea-coast do, from south-west to
  north-east, the lamina of each bed declining from the horizon towards a parallelism with
  the axis of the earth. Being struck with this observation, I made, with a quadrant, a
  great number of trials on the angles of their declination, and found them to vary from
  22°. to 60°. but averaging all my trials, the result was within one-third of a degree of
  the elevation of the pole or latitude of the place, and much the greatest part of them
  taken separately were little different from that: by which it appears, that these lamina
  are, in the main, parallel with the axis of the earth. In some instances, indeed, I
  found them perpendicular, and even reclining the other way: but these were extremely
  rare, and always attended with signs of convulsion, or other circumstances of <span
    id="page-45" class="pagenum">[ 45 ]</span> singularity, which admitted a possibility
  of removal from their original position. These trials were made between Madison's cave
  and the Patowmac. We hear of lime-stone on the Missisipi and Ohio, and in all the
  mountainous country between the eastern and western waters, not on the mountains
  themselves, but occupying the vallies between them. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d260">Near the eastern foot of the North mountain are immense bodies of <i
    id="xw20aab3d260b1">Schist</i>, containing impressions of shells in a variety of
  forms. I have received petrified shells of very different kinds from the first sources
  of the Kentucky, which bear no resemblance to any I have ever seen on the tide-waters.
  It is said that shells are found in the Andes, in South-America, fifteen thousand feet
  above the level of the ocean. This is considered by many, both of the learned and
  unlearned, as a proof of an universal deluge. To the many considerations opposing this
  opinion, the following may be added. The atmosphere, and all its contents, whether of
  water, air, or other matters, gravitate to the earth; that is to say, they have weight.
  Experience tells us, that the weight of all these together never exceeds that of a
  column of mercury of 31 inches height, which is equal to one of rainwater of 35 feet
  high. If the whole contents <span id="page-46" class="pagenum">[ 46 ]</span> of the
  atmosphere then were water, instead of what they are, it would cover the globe but 35
  feet deep; but as these waters, as they fell, would run into the seas, the superficial
  measure of which is to that of the dry parts of the globe as two to one, the seas would
  be raised only 52 ½ feet above their present level, and of course would overflow the
  lands to that height only. In Virginia this would be a very small proportion even of the
  champaign country, the banks of our tide-waters being frequently, if not generally, of a
  greater height. Deluges beyond this extent then, as for instance, to the North mountain
  or to Kentucky, seem out of the laws of nature. But within it they may have taken place
  to a greater or less degree, in proportion to the combination of natural causes which
  may be supposed to have produced them. History renders probable some instances of a
  partial deluge in the country lying round the Mediterranean sea. It has been often *
  supposed, and is not unlikely, that that sea was once a lake. While such, let us admit
  an extraordinary collection of the waters of the atmosphere from the other parts of the
  globe to have been discharged over that and the countries whose waters run into it. Or
  without supposing it a lake, admit <span id="xw20aab3d260b9" class="authorNote">* 2.

  <span id="page-47" class="pagenum">[ 47 ]</span> such an extraordinary collection of the
  waters of the atmosphere, and an influx of waters from the Atlantic ocean, forced by
  long continued Western winds. That lake, or that sea, may thus have been so raised as to
  overflow the low lands adjacent to it, as those of Egypt and Armenia, which, according
  to a tradition of the Egyptians and Hebrews, were overflowed about 2300 years before the
  Christian æra; those of Attica, said to have been overflowed in the time of Ogyges <img

  as these will not account for the shells found in the higher lands. A second opinion has
  been entertained, which is, that, in times anterior to the records either of history or
  tradition, the bed of the ocean, the principal residence of the shelled tribe, has, by
  some great convulsion of nature, been heaved to the heights at which we now find shells
  and other remains of marine animals. The favourers of this opinion do well to suppose
  the great events on which it rests to have taken place beyond all the æras of history;
  for within these, certainly none such are to be found: and we may venture to say
  further, that no fact has taken place, either in our own days, or in the thousands of
  years recorded in history, which proves the existence <span id="page-48" class="pagenum"
    >[ 48 ]</span> of any natural agents, within or without the bowels of the earth, of
  force sufficient to heave, to the height of 15,000 feet, such masses as the Andes. The
  difference between the power necessary to produce such an effect, and that which
  shuffled together the different parts of Calabria in our days, is so immense, that, from
  the existence of the latter we are not authorised to infer that of the former. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d262">M. de Voltaire <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d262b1"

    class="addEditorial">Jefferson is referring to the article on shells in Voltaire's
    <i id="xw20aab3d262b1b1">Questions sur L'Encyclopédie</i> (1770-72).</span> has
  suggested a third solution of this difficulty (Quest. encycl. Coquilles). He cites an
  instance in Touraine, where, in the space of 80 years, a particular spot of earth had
  been twice metamorphosed into soft stone, which had become hard when employed in
  building. In this stone shells of various kinds were produced, discoverable at first
  only with the microscope, but afterwards growing with the stone. From this fact, I
  suppose, he would have us infer, that, besides the usual process for generating shells
  by the elaboration of earth and water in animal vessels, nature may have provided an
  equivalent operation, by passing the same materials through the pores of calcareous
  earths and stones: as we see calcareous dropstones generating every day by the
  percolation of water through lime-stone, and new marble forming in the quarries from
  which <span id="page-49" class="pagenum">[ 49 ]</span> the old has been taken out; and
  it might be asked, whether it is more difficult for nature to shoot the calcareous juice
  into the form of a shell, than other juices into the forms of chrystals, plants,
  animals, according to the construction of the vessels through which they pass? There is
  a wonder somewhere. Is it greatest on this branch of the dilemma; on that which supposes
  the existence of a power, of which we have no evidence in any other case; or on the
  first, which requires us to believe the creation of a body of water, and its subsequent
  annihilation? The establishment of the instance, cited by M. de Voltaire, of the growth
  of shells unattached to animal bodies, would have been that of his theory. But he has
  not established it. He has not even left it on ground so respectable as to have rendered
  it an object of enquiry to the literati of his own country. Abandoning this fact,
  therefore, the three hypotheses are equally unsatisfactory; and we must be contented to
  acknowledge, that this great phænomenon is as yet unsolved. Ignorance is preferable to
  error; and he is less remote from the truth who believes nothing, than he who believes
  what is wrong. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d264" class="marginNote">Stone.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d266">There is great abundance (more especially when you approach the
  mountains) of stone, white, blue, brown, &amp; fit for the chissel, <span id="page-50"
    class="pagenum">[ 50 ]</span> good mill-stone, such also as stands the fire, and
  slate-stone. We are told of flint, fit for gun-flints, on the Meherrin in Brunswic, on
  the Missisipi between the mouth of Ohio and Kaskaskia, and on others of the western
  waters. Isinglass or mica is in several places; loadstone also, and an Asbestos of a
  ligneous texture, is sometimes to be met with. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d268" class="marginNote">Earths.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d270">Marle abounds generally. A clay, of which, like the Sturbridge in
  England, bricks are made, which will resist long the violent action of fire, has been
  found on Tuckahoe creek of James river, and no doubt will be found in other places.
  Chalk is said to be in Botetourt and Bedford. In the latter county is some earth,
  believed to be Gypseous. Ochres are found in various parts. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d272" class="marginNote">Nitre.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d274">In the lime-stone country are many caves, the earthy floors of which
  are impregnated with nitre. On Rich creek, a branch of the Great Kanhaway, about 60
  miles below the lead mines, is a very large one, about 20 yards wide, and entering a
  hill a quarter or half a mile. The vault is of rock, from 9 to 15 or 20 feet above the
  floor. A Mr. Lynch, who gives me this account, undertook to extract the nitre. Besides a
  coat of the salt which had formed on the vault and floor, he found the earth highly
  impregnated to the depth of seven feet in some places, and <span id="page-51"
    class="pagenum">[ 51 ]</span> generally of three, every bushel yielding on an
  average three pounds of nitre. Mr. Lynch having made about 10,000 lb. of the salt from
  it, consigned it to some others, who have since made 10,000 lb. They have done this by
  pursuing the cave into the hill, never trying a second time the earth they have once
  exhausted, to see how far or soon it receives another impregnation. At least fifty of
  these caves are worked on the Greenbriar. There are many of them known on Cumberland
  river. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d276" class="marginNote">Salt.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d278">The country westward of the Alleghaney abounds with springs of common
  salt. The most remarkable we have heard of are at Bullet's lick, the Big bones, the Blue
  licks, and on the North fork of Holston. The area of Bullet's lick is of many acres.
  Digging the earth to the depth of three feet, the water begins to boil up, and the
  deeper you go, and the drier the weather, the stronger is the brine. A thousand gallons
  of water yield from a bushel to a bushel and a half of salt, which is about 80 lb. of
  water to one lb. of salt; but of sea-water 25 1b. yield one lb. of salt. So that
  sea-water is more than three times as strong as that of these springs. A salt spring has
  been lately discovered at the Turkey foot on Yohogany, by which river it is overflowed,
  except at very low water. <span id="page-52" class="pagenum">[ 52 ]</span> Its merit is
  not yet known. Duning's lick is also as yet untried, but it is supposed to be the best
  on this side the Ohio. The salt springs on the margin of the Onondago lake are said to
  give a saline taste to the waters of the lake. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d280" class="marginNote">Medicinal springs.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d282">There are several Medicinal springs, some of which are indubitably
  efficacious, while others seem to owe their reputation as much to fancy, and change of
  air and regimen, as to their real virtues. None of them having undergone a chemical
  analysis in skilful hands, nor been so far the subject of observations as to have
  produced a reduction into classes of the disorders which they relieve, it is in my power
  to give little more than an enumeration of them. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d284">The most efficacious of these are two springs in Augusta, near the
  first sources of James river, where it is called Jackson's river. They rise near the
  foot of the ridge of mountains, generally called the Warm spring mountain, but in the
  maps Jackson's mountains. The one is distinguished by the name of the Warm spring, and
  the other of the Hot spring <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d284b1" class="editorialTrigger"
  src="editorial.png" /><span id="xw20aab3d284b1" class="addEditorial">Warm Springs
    and Hot Springs, in Bath County, Virginia. Jefferson visited here in 1818, using a
    (still-standing) pool house that was built in 1761; the waters are now referred to
    as the Jefferson Pools.</span>. The Warm spring issues with a very bold stream,
  sufficient to work a grist-mill, and to keep the waters of its bason, which is 30 feet
  in diameter, at the vital warmth, viz. 96°. of Farenheit's thermometer. The <span
    id="page-53" class="pagenum">[ 53 ]</span> matter with which these waters is allied
  is very volatile; its smell indicates it to be sulphureous, as also does the
  circumstance of its turning silver black. They relieve rheumatisms. Other complaints
  also of very different natures have been removed or lessened by them. It rains here four
  or five days in every week. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d286">The <i id="xw20aab3d286b1">Hot spring</i> is about six miles from the
  Warm, is much smaller, and has been so hot as to have boiled an egg. Some believe its
  degree of heat to be lessened. It raises the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer to 112
  degrees, which is fever heat. It sometimes relieves where the Warm spring fails. A
  fountain of common water, issuing within a few inches of its margin, gives it a singular
  appearance. Comparing the temperature of these with that of the Hot springs of
  Kamschatka, of which Krachininnikow <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d286b3"

  of boiling water. These springs are very much resorted to in spite of a total want of
  accommodation for the sick. Their waters are strongest in the hottest months, which
  occasions their being visited in July and August principally. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d288">The Sweet springs are in the county of Botetourt, at the eastern foot
  of the <span id="page-54" class="pagenum">[ 54 ]</span> Alleghaney, about 42 miles from
  the Warm springs. They are still less known. Having been found to relieve cases in which
  the others had been ineffectually tried, it is probable their composition is different.
  They are different also in their temperature, being as cold as common water: which is
  not mentioned, however, as a proof of a distinct impregnation. This is among the first
  sources of James river. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d290">On Patowmac river, in Berkeley county, above the North mountain, are
  Medicinal springs, much more frequented than those of Augusta. Their powers, however,
  are less, the waters weakly mineralized, and scarcely warm. They are more visited,
  because situated in a fertile, plentiful, and populous country, better provided with
  accommodations, always safe from the Indians, and nearest to the more populous states. </p>

  <p id="xw20aab3d304">In the low grounds of the Great Kanhaway, 7 miles above the mouth of
  Elk river, and 67 above that of the Kanhaway itself, is a hole in the earth of the
  capacity of 30 or 40 gallons, from which issues constantly a bituminous vapour in so
  strong a current, as to give to the sand about its orifice the motion which it has in a
  boiling spring. On presenting a lighted candle or torch within 18 inches of the hole, it
  flames up in a column of 18 inches diameter, and four or five feet height, which
  sometimes burns out within 20 minutes, and at other times has been known to continue
  three days, and then has been left still burning. The flame is unsteady, of the density
  of that of burning spirits, and smells like burning pit coal. Water sometimes collects
  in the bason, which is remarkably cold, and is kept in ebullition by the vapour issuing
  through it. If the vapour be fired in that state, the water soon becomes so warm that
  the hand cannot bear it, and evaporates wholly in a short time. This, with the

  There is one of these near the intersection of the Lord Fairfax's boundary with the
  North mountain, not far from Brock's gap, on the stream of which is a grist-mill, which
  grinds two bushel of grain at every flood of the spring. Another, near the Cow-pasture
  river, a mile and a half below its confluence with the Bull-pasture river, and 16 or 17
  miles from the Hot springs, which intermits once in every twelve hours. One also near
  the mouth of the North Holston. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d312">After these may be mentioned the <i id="xw20aab3d312b1">Natural

  than a common well: the water rises in it as near the surface of the earth as in the
  neighbouring artificial wells, and is of a depth as yet unknown. It is said there is a
  current in it tending sensibly downwards. If this be true, it probably feeds some
  fountain, of which it is the natural reservoir, distinguished from others, like that of
  Madison's cave, by being accessible. It is used with a bucket and windlass as an

  syphon. In that case it becomes a common spring. should this duct be again closed or

  <p id="xw20aab3d634">Our quadrupeds have been mostly described by Linnæus and Mons. de
  Buffon. Of these the Mammoth, or big buffalo, as called by the Indians, must certainly
  have been the largest. Their tradition is, that he was carnivorous, and still exists in
  the northern parts of America. A delegation of warriors from the Delaware tribe having
  visited the governor of Virginia <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d634b1"
  class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span id="xw20aab3d634b1"
    class="addEditorial">That would be Jefferson himself, who served as governor of
    Virginia from 1779 to 1781, at the time when this incident would have taken place.
    Jefferson's desire to show that mammoths survived into historical memory serves the
    purpose of refuting Buffon's claim that animals and plants degenerated in the
    climate of the New World. By offering evidence (which we now know to be incorrect)
    that large animals like mammoths--larger than anything found in Europe--existed
    recently and may still exist in the Americas, Jefferson hoped to refute Buffon and
    argue for the fertility and fecundity of his native land. Indeed, for much of this
    Query, the vast amount of evidence that Jefferson offers for the variety of plants,
    animals, and minerals present in Virginia, and in particular the size of its larger
    animals, while it may run the risk of seeming like overkill to the modern reader, is
    designed to serve as a kind of argument-by-sheer-quantity against Buffon's
    influential writings.</span>, during the present revolution, on matters of business,
  after these had been discussed and settled in council, the governor asked them some
  questions relative to their country, and, among others, what they knew or had heard of
  the animal whose bones were found at the Saltlicks, on the Ohio. Their chief speaker
  immediately put himself into an attitude of oratory, and with a pomp suited to what he
  conceived the elevation of his subject, informed him that it was a tradition handed down
  from their fathers, 'That in antient times a herd of these tremendous animals came to
  the Big-bone licks, and began an universal destruction of the bear, deer, elks,
  buffaloes, and other animals, <span id="page-65" class="pagenum">[ 65 ]</span> which had
  been created for the use of the Indians: that the Great Man above, looking down and
  seeing this, was so enraged that he seized his lightning, descended on the earth, seated
  himself on a neighbouring mountain, on a rock, of which his seat and the print of his
  feet are still to be seen, and hurled his bolts among them till the whole were
  slaughtered, except the big bull, who presenting his forehead to the shafts, shook them
  off as they fell; but missing one at length, it wounded him in the side; whereon,
  springing round, he bounded over the Ohio, over the Wabash, the Illinois, and finally
  over the great lakes, where he is living at this day.' It is well known that on the
  Ohio, and in many parts of America further north, tusks, grinders, and skeletons of
  unparalleled magnitude, are found in great numbers, some lying on the surface of the
  earth, and some a little below it. A Mr. Stanley, taken prisoner by the Indians near the
  mouth of the Tanissee, relates, that, after being transferred through several tribes,
  from one to another, he was at length carried over the mountains west of the Missouri to
  a river which runs westwardly; that these bones abounded there; and that the natives
  described to him the animal to which they belonged as still existing in the <span
    id="page-66" class="pagenum">[ 66 ]</span> northern parts of their country; from
  which description he judged it to be an elephant. Bones of the same kind have been
  lately found, some feet below the surface of the earth, in salines opened on the North
  Holston, a branch of the Tanissee, about the latitude of 36½°. North. From the accounts
  published in Europe, I suppose it to be decided, that these are of the same kind with
  those found in Siberia. Instances are mentioned of like animal remains found in the more
  southern climates of both hemispheres; but they are either so loosely mentioned as to
  leave a doubt of the fact, so inaccurately described as not to authorize the classing
  them with the great northern bones, or so rare as to found a suspicion that they have
  been carried thither as curiosities from more northern regions. So that on the whole
  there seem to be no certain vestiges of the existence of this animal further south than
  the salines last mentioned. It is remarkable that the tusks and skeletons have been
  ascribed by the naturalists of Europe to the elephant, while the grinders have been
  given to the hippopotamus, or riverhorse. Yet it is acknowledged, that the tusks and
  skeletons are much larger than those of the elephant, and the grinders many times
  greater than those of the hippopotamus, and essentially different in form. Wherever
  these grinders are found, there also we find <span id="page-67" class="pagenum">[ 67
    ]</span> the tusks and skeleton; but no skeleton of the hippopotamus nor grinders of
  the elephant. It will not be said that the hippopotamus and elephant came always to the
  same spot, the former to deposit his grinders, and the latter his tusks and skeleton.
  For what became of the parts not deposited there? We must agree then that these remains
  belong to each other, that they are of one and the same animal, that this was not a
  hippopotamus, because the hippopotamus had no tusks nor such a frame, and because the
  grinders differ in their size as well as in the number and form of their points. That it
  was not an elephant, I think ascertained by proofs equally decisive. I will not avail
  myself of the authority of the celebrated * anatomist, who, from an examination of the
  form and structure of the tusks, has declared they were essentially different from those
  of the elephant; because another &#8224; anatomist, equally celebrated, has declared, on
  a like examination, that they are precisely the same. Between two such authorities I
  will suppose this circumstance equivocal. But, 1. The skeleton of the mammoth (for so
  the incognitum has been called) bespeaks an animal of five or six times the cubic volume
  of the elephant, as Mons. de Buffon has admitted. 2. The grinders are five times as

  surface studded with four or five rows of blunt points: whereas those of the elephant
  are broad and thin, and their grinding surface flat. 3. I have never heard an instance,
  and suppose there has been none, of the grinder of an elephant being found in America.
  4. From the known temperature and constitution of the elephant he could never have
  existed in those regions where the remains of the mammoth have been found. The elephant
  is a native only of the torrid zone and its vicinities: if, with the assistance of warm
  apartments and warm clothing, he has been preserved in life in the temperate climates of
  Europe, it has only been for a small portion of what would have been his natural period,
  and no instance of his multiplication in them has ever been known. But no bones of the
  mammoth, as I have before observed, have been ever found further south than the salines
  of the Holston, and they have been found as far north as the Arctic circle. Those,
  therefore, who are of opinion that the elephant and mammoth are the same, must believe,
  1. That the elephant known to us can exist and multiply in the frozen zone; or, 2. That
  an internal fire may once have warmed those regions, and since abandoned them, of which,
  however, the globe exhibits no unequivocal indications; or,</p> <span

  <p>M. de Buffon considers the existence of Elephant bones in Northern regions, where the
  animal itself is no longer found, as one of the leading facts which support his
  theory that the earth was once in a liquid state, rendered so by the action of fire,
  that the process of cooling began at its poles, and proceeded gradually towards the
  torrid zone, that with this progress the animals of warm temperature retired towards
  the equator, and that in the present state of that progress the globe remains of
  sufficient warmth, for the elephant for instance, in the tropical regions, only to
  which therefore they have retired, as their last asylum and where they must become
  extinct when the degree of warmth shall be reduced below that adapted to their
  constitution. how does it happen then that no elephants exist at present in the
  tropical regions of America, to which those of the Ohio must have retired, according
  to this theory.</p>
  <span id="page-69" class="pagenum">[ 69 ]</span> <p>3. That the obliquity of the ecliptic,
  when these elephants lived, was so great as to include within the tropics all those
  regions in which the bones are found; the tropics being, as is before observed, the
  natural limits of habitation for the elephant. But if it be admitted that this obliquity
  has really decreased, and we adopt the highest rate of decrease yet pretended, that is,
  of one minute in a century, to transfer the northern tropic to the Arctic circle, would
  carry the existence of these supposed elephants 250,000 years back; a period far beyond
  our conception of the duration of animal bones left exposed to the open air, as these
  are in many instances. Besides, though these regions would then be supposed within the
  tropics, yet their winters would have been too severe for the sensibility of the
  elephant. They would have had too but one day and one night in the year, a circumstance
  to which we have no reason to suppose the nature of the elephant fitted. However, it has
  been demonstrated, that, if a variation of obliquity in the ecliptic takes place as all,
  it is vibratory, and never exceeds the limits of 9 degrees, which is not sufficient to
  bring these bones within the tropics. One of these hypotheses, or some other equally
  voluntary and inadmissible to cautious philosophy, must be adopted to <span id="page-70"
    class="pagenum">[ 70 ]</span> support the opinion that these are the bones of the
  elephant. For my own part, I find it easier to believe that an animal may have existed,
  resembling the elephant in his tusks, and general anatomy, while his nature was in other
  respects extremely different. From the 30th degree of South latitude to the 30th of
  North, are nearly the limits which nature has fixed for the existence and multiplication
  of the elephant known to us. Proceeding thence northwardly to 36½ degrees, we enter
  those assigned to the mammoth. The further we advance North, the more their vestiges
  multiply as far as the earth has been explored in that direction; and it is as probable
  as otherwise, that this progression continues to the pole itself, if land extends so
  far. The center of the Frozen zone then may be the Achmé of their vigour, as that of the
  Torrid is of the elephant. Thus nature seems to have drawn a belt of separation between
  these two tremendous animals, whose breadth indeed is not precisely known, though at
  present we may suppose it about 6½ degrees of latitude; to have assigned to the elephant
  the regions South of these confines, and those North to the mammoth, founding the
  constitution of the one in her extreme of heat, and that of the other in the extreme of
  cold. When the Creator has therefore separated <span id="page-71" class="pagenum">[ 71
    ]</span> their nature as far as the extent of the scale of animal life allowed to
  this planet would permit, it seems perverse to declare it the same, from a partial
  resemblance of their tusks and bones. But to whatever animal we ascribe these remains,
  it is certain such a one has existed in America, and that it has been the largest of all
  terrestrial beings. It should have sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited, and
  the atmosphere it breathed, from the imputation of impotence in the conception and
  nourishment of animal life on a large scale: to have stifled, in its birth, the opinion
  of a writer, the most learned too of all others in the science of animal history, that
  in the new world, 'La nature vivante est beaucoup moins agissante, beaucoup moins forte
  <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d634c40" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png"
  /><span id="xw20aab3d634c40" class="addEditorial">"Living nature is much less
    active, much less strong."</span>:' that nature is less active, less energetic on
  one side of the globe than she is on the other. As if both sides were not warmed by the
  same genial sun; as if a soil of the same chemical composition, was less capable of
  elaboration into animal nutriment; as if the fruits and grains from that soil and sun,
  yielded a less rich chyle, gave less extension to the solids and fluids of the body, or
  produced sooner in the cartilages, membranes, and fibres, that rigidity which restrains
  all further extension, and terminates animal growth. The truth is, that a Pigmy <span
    id="page-72" class="pagenum">[ 72 ]</span> and a Patagonian, a Mouse and a Mammoth,
  derive their dimensions from the same nutritive juices. The difference of increment
  depends on circumstances unsearchable to beings with our capacities. Every race of
  animals seems to have received from their Maker certain laws of extension at the time of
  their formation. Their elaborative organs were formed to produce this, while proper
  obstacles were opposed to its further progress. Below these limits they cannot fall, nor
  rise above them. What intermediate station they shall take may depend on soil, on
  climate, on food, on a careful choice of breeders. But all the manna of heaven would
  never raise the Mouse to the bulk of the Mammoth. </p>
  <div id="xw20aab3d636" class="marginNote">xviii, 100 &#8211;&#8211;156</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3d638">The opinion advanced by the Count de Buffon, is 1. That the animals
  common both to the old and new world, are smaller in the latter. 2. That those peculiar
  to the new, are on a smaller scale. 3. That those which have been domesticated in both,
  have degenerated in America: and 4. That on the whole it exhibits fewer species. And the
  reason he thinks is, that the heats of America are less; that more waters are spread
  over its surface by nature, and fewer of these drained off by the hand of man. In other
  words, that <i id="xw20aab3d638b1">heat</i> is friendly, and <i id="xw20aab3d638b3"
    >moisture</i>
  <span id="page-73" class="pagenum">[ 73 ]</span> adverse to the production and
  developement of large quadrupeds. I will not meet this hypothesis on its first doubtful
  ground, whether the climate of America be comparatively more humid? Because we are not
  furnished with observations sufficient to decide this question. And though, till it be
  decided, we are as free to deny, as others are to affirm the fact, yet for a moment let
  it be supposed. The hypothesis, after this supposition, proceeds to another; that <i
    id="xw20aab3d638c11">moisture</i> is unfriendly to animal growth. The truth of this
  is inscrutable to us by reasonings a priori. Nature has hidden from us her modus agendi.
  Our only appeal on such questions is to experience; and I think that experience is
  against the supposition. It is by the assistance of <i id="xw20aab3d638c13">heat</i> and
  <i id="xw20aab3d638c15">moisture</i> that vegetables are elaborated from the
  elements of earth, air, water, and fire. We accordingly see the more humid climates
  produce the greater quantity of vegetables. Vegetables are mediately or immediately the
  food of every animal: and in proportion to the quantity of food, we see animals not only
  multiplied in their numbers, but improved in their bulk, as far as the laws of their
  nature will admit. Of this opinion is the Count de Buffon himself in another part of his
  work 'en general il paroit que les pays un peu <!-- commented out div, creating a line break <div id="xw20aab3d638c17" class="marginNote">vii. 134.</div>-->

  it is their contraries <i id="xw20aab3d638c34">heat</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d638c36"
    >dryness</i> which enlarge it. But when we appeal to experience, we are not to rest
  satisfied with a single fact. Let us therefore try our question on more general ground.
  Let us take two portions of the earth, Europe and America for instance, sufficiently
  extensive to give operation to general causes; let us consider the circumstances
  peculiar to each, and observe their effect on animal nature. America, running through
  the torrid as well as temperate zone, has more <i id="xw20aab3d638c38">heat</i>,
  collectively taken, than Europe. But Europe, according to our hypothesis, is the <i
    id="xw20aab3d638c40">dryest</i>. They are equally adapted then to animal
  productions; each being endowed with one of those causes which befriend animal growth,
  and with one which opposes it. If it be thought unequal to compare Europe <span
    id="page-75" class="pagenum">[ 75 ]</span> with America, which is so much larger, I
  answer, not more so than to compare America with the whole world. Besides, the purpose
  of the comparison is to try an hypothesis, which makes the size of animals depend on the
  <i id="xw20aab3d638c44">heat</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d638c46">moisture</i> of
  climate. If therefore we take a region, so extensive as to comprehend a sensible
  distinction of climate, and so extensive too as that local accidents, or the intercourse
  of animals on its borders, may not materially affect the size of those in its interior
  parts, we shall comply with those conditions which the hypothesis may reasonably demand.
  The objection would be the weaker in the present case, because any intercourse of
  animals which may take place on the confines of Europe and Asia, is to the advantage of
  the former, Asia producing certainly larger animals than Europe. Let us then take a
  comparative view of the Quadrupeds of Europe and America, presenting them to the eye in
  three different tables, in one of which shall be enumerated those found in both
  countries; in a second those found in one only; in a third those which have been
  domesticated in both. To facilitate the comparison, let those of each table be arranged
  in gradation according to their sizes, from the greatest to the smallest, so far as
  their sizes can be conjectured. The <span id="page-76" class="pagenum">[ 76 ]</span>
  weights of the large animals shall be expressed in the English avoirdupoise pound and
  its decimals: those of the smaller in the ounce and its decimals. Those which are marked
  thus *, are actual weights of particular subjects, deemed among the largest of their
  species. Those marked thus &#8224;, are furnished by judicious persons, well acquainted
  with the species, and saying, from conjecture only, what the largest individual they had
  seen would probably have weighed. The other weights are taken from Messrs. Buffon and
  D'Aubenton, and are of such subjects as came casually to their hands for dissection.
  This circumstance must be remembered where their weights and mine stand opposed: the
  latter being stated, not to produce a conclusion in favour of the American species, but
  to justify a suspension of opinion until we are better informed, and a suspicion in the
  mean time that there is no uniform difference in favour of either; which is all I
  pretend. </p>

  D'Aubenton says that the Renne of Europe is but about the size of a Red-deer. The wesel

  The latter tells us, that the lynx badger, red fox, and flying squirrel, are the <i
    id="xw20aab3d682c33">same</i> in America as in Europe: by which expression I
  understand, they are the same in all material circumstances, in size as well as others:
  for if they were smaller, they would differ from the European. Our grey fox is, by
  Catesby's account, <!--<div id="xw20aab3d682c35" class="marginNote">II. 78. </div>-->
  little different in size and shape from the European fox. I presume he means the red fox
  of Europe, <span id="page-83" class="pagenum">[ 83 ]</span> as does Kalm, where he says,
  that in size <!--<div id="xw20aab3d682c42" class="marginNote">I. 220.</div>--> 'they do not
  quite come up to our foxes.' For proceeding next to the red fox of America, he says
  'they are entirely the same with the European sort.' Which shews he had in view one
  European sort only, which was the red. So that the result of their testimony is, that
  the American grey fox is somewhat less than the European red; which is equally true of
  the grey fox of Europe, as may be seen by comparing the measures of the Count de Buffon
  and Mons. D'Aubenton. <!--<div id="xw20aab3d682c44" class="marginNote">XXVII. <br

            IX. 1.</div>--> The white bear of America is as large as that of Europe. The bones of
  the Mammoth which have been found in America, are as large as those found in the old
  world. It may be asked, why I insert the Mammoth, as if it still existed? I ask in
  return, why I should omit it, as if it did not exist? Such is the oeconomy of nature,
  that no instance can be produced of her having permitted any one race of her animals to
  become extinct; of her having formed any link in her great work so weak as to be broken.
  To add to this, the traditionary testimony of the Indians, that this animal still exists
  in the northern and western parts of America, would be adding the light of a taper to
  that of the meridian sun. Those parts still remain in their aboriginal state, unexplored
  and <span id="page-84" class="pagenum">[ 84 ]</span> undisturbed by us, or by others for
  us, He may as well exist there now, as he did formerly where we find his bones. If he be
  a carnivorous animal, as some Anatomists have conjectured, and the Indians affirm, his
  early retirement may be accounted for from the general destruction of the wild game by
  the Indians, which commences in the first instant of their connection with us, for the
  purpose of purchasing matchcoats, hatchets, and fire locks, with their skins. There
  remain then the buffalo, red deer, fallow deer, wolf, roe, glutton <img

    id="xw20aab3d682c53" class="addEditorial">Ground-hog.</span>, vison, hedge-hog,
  martin, and water rat, of the comparative sizes of which we have not sufficient
  testimony. It does not appear that Messrs. de Buffon and D'Aubenton have measured,
  weighed, or seen those of America. It is said of some of them, by some travellers, that
  they are smaller than the European. But who were these travellers? Have they not been
  men of a very different description from those who have laid open to us the other three
  quarters of the world? Was natural history the object of their travels? Did they measure
  or weigh the animals they speak of? or did they not judge of them by sight, or perhaps
  even from report only? Were they are acquainted with the animals of their own country,
  with which they undertake to <span id="page-85" class="pagenum">[ 85 ]</span> compare
  them? Have they not been so ignorant as often to mistake the species? A true answer to
  these questions would probably lighten their authority, so as to render it insufficient
  for the foundation of an hypothesis. How unripe we yet are, for an accurate comparison
  of the animals of the two countries, will appear from the work of Mons. de Buffon. The
  ideas we should have formed of the sizes of some animals, from the information he had
  received at his first publications concerning them, are very different from what his
  subsequent communications give us. And indeed his candour in this can never be too much
  praised. One sentence of his book must do him immortal honour. <!--<div id="xw20aab3d682c60"

  further corrections. The wonder is, not that there is yet something in this great work
  to correct, but that there is so little. The result of this view then is, that of 26
  quadrupeds common to both countries, 7 are said to be larger in America, 7 of equal
  size, and 12, not sufficiently examined. So that the first table impeaches the first
  member of the assertion, that of the animals common to both countries, the American are
  smallest, 'et cela sans aucune exception.' It shews it not just, in all the latitude in
  which its author has advanced it, and probably not to such a degree as to found a
  distinction between the two countries. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d684">Proceeding to the second table, which arranges the animals found in one
  of the two countries only, Mons. de Buffon observes, that the tapir, the elephant of
  America, is but of the size of a small cow. To preserve our comparison, I will add that
  the wild boar, the elephant of Europe, is little more than half that size. I have made
  an elk with round or cylindrical horns, an animal of America, and peculiar to it because
  I have seen many of them myself, and more of their horns; and because I can say, from
  the best information, that, in Virgina, this kind of elk has abounded much, and still
  <span id="page-87" class="pagenum">[ 87 ]</span> exists in smaller numbers; and I
  could never learn that the palmated kind had been seen here at all. I suppose this
  confined to the more Northern latitudes*. I have made our <span id="xw20aab3d684b6"

    the article Elan, authorize the supposition, that the flat-horned elk is found in
    the northern parts of America. It has not however extended to our latitudes. On the
    other hand, I could never learn that the round-horned elk has been seen further
    North than the Hudson's river. This agrees with the former elk in its general
    character, being, like that, when compared with a deer, very much larger, its ears
    longer, broader, and thicker in proportion, its hair much longer, neck and tail
    shorter, having a dewlap before the breast (caruncula gutturalis Linnaei) a white
    spot often, if not always, of a foot diameter, on the hinder part of the buttocks
    round the tail; its gait a trot, and attended with a rattling of the hoofs: but
    distinguished from that decisively by its horns, which are not palmated, but round
    and pointed. This is the animal described by Catesby as the Cervus major Americanus,
    the Stag of America, le Cerf de l'Amerique. But it differs from the Cervus as
    totally, as does the palmated elk from the dama. And in fact it seems to stand in
    the same relation to the palmated elk, as the red deer does to the fallow. It has
    abounded in Virginia, has been seen, within my knowledge, on the Eastern side of the
    Blue ridge since the year 1765, is now common beyond those mountains, has been often
    brought to us and tamed, and their horns are in the hands of many. I should
    designate it as the 'Alces Americanus cornibus</span>

  to b different from both the European animals or those denominations, and calling it

    id="xw20aab3d684c18" class="authorNote">teretibus. It were to be wished, that
    Naturalists, who are acquainted with the renne and elk of Europe, and who may
    hereafter visit the northern parts of America, would examine well the animals called
    there by the names of grey and black moose, caribou, orignal, and elk. Mons. de
    Buffon has done what could be done from the materials in his hands, towards clearing
    up the confusion introduced by the loose application of these names among the
    animals they are meant to designate. He reduces the whole to the renne and
    flathorned elk. From all the information I have been able to collect, I strongly
    suspect they will be found to cover three, if not four distinct species of animals.
    I have seen skins of a moose, and of the caribou: they differ more from each other,
    and from that of the roundhorned elk, than I ever saw two skins differ which
    belonged to different individuals of any wild species. These differences are in the
    colour, length, and coarseness of the hair, and in the size, texture, and marks of
    the skin. Perhaps it will be found that there is, 1. the moose, black and grey, the
    former being said to be the male, and the latter the female, 2. The caribou or
    renne. 3. The flat-horned elk, or orignal. 4. The round-horned elk. Should this
    last, though possessing so nearly the characters of the elk, be found to be the same
    with the Cerf d'Ardennes or Brandhirtz of Germany, still there will remain the three
    species first enumerated.</span>
  <span id="page-89" class="pagenum">[ 89 ]</span> according to our own knowledge, derived
  from daily sight of them, because I am not able to reconcile with that the European
  appellations and descriptions. I have heard of other species, but they have never come
  within my own notice. These, I think, are the only instances in which I have departed
  from the authority of Mons. de Buffon in the construction of this table. I take him for
  my ground work, because I think him the best informed of any Naturalist who has ever
  written. The result is, that there are 18 quadrupeds peculiar to Europe; more than four
  times as many, to wit 74, peculiar to America; that the * first of these 74 weighs more
  than the whole column of Europeans; and consequently this second table disproves the
  second member of the assertion, that the <span id="xw20aab3d684c22" class="authorNote">*
    The Tapir is the largest of the animals peculiar to America. I collect his weight
    thus. Mons. de Buffon says, XXIII. 274. that he is of the size of a Zebu, or a small
    cow. He gives us the measures of of a Zebu, ib. 94. as taken by himself, viz. 5 feet
    7 inches from the muzzle to the root of the tail, and 5 feet 1 inch circumference
    behind the fore legs. A bull, measuring in the same way 6 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 2
    inches, weighed 600 lb. VIII. 153. The Zebu then, and of course the Tapir, would
    weigh about 500 lb. But one individual of every species of European peculiars would
    probably weigh less than 400 lb. These are French measures and weights.</span>
  <span id="page-90" class="pagenum">[ 90 ]</span> animals peculiar to the new world are
  on a smaller scale, so far as that assertion relied on European animals for support: and
  it is in full opposition to the theory which makes the animal volume to depend on the
  circumstances of <i id="xw20aab3d684c26">heat</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d684c28"
    >moisture</i>. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d686">The IIId. table comprehends those quadrupeds only which are domestic in
  both countries. That some of these, in some parts of America, have become less than
  their original stock, is doubtless true; and the reason is very obvious. In a thinly
  peopled country, the spontaneous productions of the forests and waste fields are
  sufficient to support indifferently the domestic animals of the farmer, with a very
  little aid from him in the severest and scarcest season. He therefore finds it more
  convenient to receive them from the hand of nature in that indifferent state, than to
  keep up their size by a care and nourishment which would cost him much labour. If, on
  this low fare, these animals dwindle, it is no more than they do in those parts of
  Europe where the poverty of the soil, or poverty of the owner, reduces them to the same
  scanty subsistance. It is the uniform effect of one and the same cause, whether acting
  on this or that side of the globe. It would be erring therefore against that rule of
  philosophy, which teaches us to ascribe <span id="page-91" class="pagenum">[ 91 ]</span>
  like effects to like causes, should we impute this diminution of size in America to any
  imbecility or want of uniformity in the operations of nature. It may be affirmed with
  truth that, in those countries, and with those individuals of America, where necessity
  or curiosity has produced equal attention as in Europe to the nourishment of animals,
  the horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs of the one continent are as large as those of the
  other. There are particular instances, well attested, where individuals of this country
  have imported good breeders from England, and have improved their size by care in the
  course of some years. To make a fair comparison between the two countries, it will not
  answer to bring together animals of what might be deemed the middle or ordinary size of
  their species; because an error in judging of that middle or ordinary size would vary
  the result of the comparison. <!--<div id="xw20aab3d686b6" class="marginNote">VII.
            432.</div>--> Thus Monsieur D'Aubenton considers a horse of 4 feet 5 inches high and
  400 lb. weight French, equal to 4 feet 8.6 inches and 436 lb. English, as a middle sized
  horse. Such a one is deemed a small horse in America. The extremes must therefore be
  resorted to. The same anatomist dissected a horse of 5 feet 9 inches height <!--<div
            id="xw20aab3d686b8" class="marginNote">VII. 474.</div>--> French measure, equal to 6
  feet 1.7 English. This is near 6 inches higher than any horse <span id="page-92"
    class="pagenum">[ 92 ]</span> I have seen: and could it be supposed that I had seen
  the largest horses in America, the conclusion would be, that ours have diminished, or
  that we have bred from a smaller stock. In Connecticut and Rhode-Island, where the
  climate is favorable to the production of grass, bullocks have been slaughtered which
  weighed 2500, 2200, and 2100 lb. nett; and those of 1800 lb. have been frequent. I have
  seen a * hog weigh 1050 1b. after the blood, bowels, and hair had been taken from him.
  Before he was killed an attempt was made to weigh him with a pair of steel-yards,
  graduated to 1200 lb. but he weighed more. Yet this hog was probably not within fifty
  generations of the European stock. I am well informed of another which weighed 1100 lb.
  gross. Asses have been still more neglected than any other domestic animal in America.
  They are neither fed nor housed in the most rigorous season of the year. <!--<div
            id="xw20aab3d686c15" class="marginNote">VIII. 48. 55. 66.</div>--> Yet they are larger
  than those measured by Mons. D'Aubenton, of 3 feet 7¼ inches, 3 feet 4 inches, and 3
  feet 2½ inches, the latter weighing only 215.81b. These sizes, I suppose, have been
  produced by the same negligence in Europe, which has produced a like diminution here.
  Where care has been taken of them on that side of the <span id="xw20aab3d686c17"
    class="authorNote">* In Williamsburg, April, 1769.</span>
  <span id="page-93" class="pagenum">[ 93 ]</span> water, they have been raised to a size
  bordering on that of the horse; not by the <i id="xw20aab3d686c24">heat</i> and <i
    id="xw20aab3d686c26">dryness</i> of the climate, but by good food and shelter. Goats
  have been also much neglected in America. Yet they are very prolific here, bearing twice
  or three times a year, and from one to five kids at a birth. <!--<div id="xw20aab3d686c28"
            class="marginNote">XVIII. 96.</div>--> Mons. de Buffon has been sensible of a
  difference in this circumstance in favour of America. But what are their greatest
  weights I cannot say. A large sheep here weighs 100 lb. <!--<div id="xw20aab3d686c30"
            class="marginNote">IX. 41.</div>--> I observe Mons. D'Aubenton calls a ram of 62 lb.
  one of the middle size. But to say what are the extremes of growth in these and the
  other domestic animals of America, would require information of which no one individual
  is possessed. The weights actually known and stated in the third table preceding will
  suffice to shew, that we may conclude, on probable grounds, that, with equal food and
  care, the climate of America will preserve the races of domestic animals as large as the
  European stock from which they are derived; and consequently that the third member of
  Mons. de Buffon's assertion, that the domestic animals are subject to degeneration from
  the climate of America, is as probably wrong as the first and second were certainly so. </p>
  <span id="page-94" class="pagenum">[ 94 ]</span>
  <p id="xw20aab3d694">That the last part of it is erroneous, which affirms that the species
  of American quadrupeds are comparatively few, is evident from the tables taken all
  together. By these it appears that there are an hundred species aboriginal of America.
  <!--<div id="xw20aab3d694b1" class="marginNote">XXX. 219.</div>--> Mons. de Buffon supposes
  about double that number existing on the whole earth. Of these Europe, Asia, and Africa,
  furnish suppose 126; that is, the 26 common to Europe and America, and about 100 which
  are not in America at all. The American species then are to those of the rest of the
  earth, as 106 to 126, or 4 to 5. But the residue of the earth being double the extent of
  America, the exact proportion would have been but as 4 to 8. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d696">Hitherto I have considered this hypothesis as applied to brute animals
  only, and not in its extension to the man of America, whether aboriginal or
  transplanted. It is the opinion of Mons. de Buffon that the former furnishes no
  exception to it. <!--<div id="xw20aab3d696b1" class="marginNote">XVIII.146</div>--> 'Quoique le

    diminishment of living nature in the entirety of that continent. The savage is weak
    and small in the organs of generation; he has neither hair nor beard nor ardor for
    his female; although he is faster than the European because he is more accustomed to
    running, he is nonetheless less strong of body; he is also less sensitive and as a

    cause of the dispersed life of the savages or their estrangement from society: that
    most precious spark of nature has been refused them; they lack ardor for their
    females, and as a result for their fellows: they know nothing of the most powerful
    attachment, the most tender of all, the other emotions of that kind have become cold

    of one family to another has no tie at all: their is no reunion, no republic, no

    society cold, and their empire harsh. They only regard their wives as they do
    servants or beasts whom they load, without thought, from their hunt, and whom they
    force without mercy, without gratitude, to work that is often beyond their strength:
    they have but a few children; they take little care of them; they feel the full pain

    their indifference for the female sex is the original stain that condemns their

  This belief is founded on what I have seen of man, white, red, and black, and what has
  been written of him by authors, enlightened themselves, and writing amidst an
  enlightened people. The Indian of North America being more within our reach, I can speak
  of him somewhat from <span id="page-97" class="pagenum">[ 97 ]</span> my own knowledge
  but more from the information of others better acquainted with him, and on whose truth
  and judgment I can rely. From these sources I am able to say, in contradiction to this
  representation, that he is neither more defective in ardor, nor more impotent with his
  female, than the white reduced to the same diet and exercise: that he is brave, when an
  enterprize depends on bravery; education with him making the point of honor consist in
  the destruction of an enemy by stratagem, and in the preservation of his own person free
  from injury; or perhaps this is nature; while it is education which teaches us to *

    cowardice which he had observed in those of the present race might he the effect of
    subjugation. But, supposing the Indians of North America to be cowards also, he
    concludes the ancestors of those of South America to have been so too, and therefore
    that those authors have given fictions for truths. He was probably not acquainted
    himself with the Indians of North America, and had formed his opinion of them from
    hear-say. Great numbers of French, of English, and of Americans, are perfectly
    acquainted with these people. Had he had an opportunity of enquiring of any of
    these, they would have told him, that there never was an instance known of an Indian
    begging his life when in the power of his enemies: on the contrary, that he courts
    death by every possible insult and provocation. His reasoning then would have been
    reversed thus. 'Since the present Indian of North America is brave, and authors tell

  sex therefore imposes on the weaker. It is civilization alone which replaces women in
  the enjoyment of their natural equality. That first teaches us to subdue the selfish
  passions, and to respect those rights in others which we value in ourselves. Were we in
  equal barbarism, our females would be equal drudges. The man with them is less strong
  than with us, but their woman stronger than ours; and both for the same obvious reason;
  because our man and their woman is habituated to labour, and formed by it. With both
  races the sex which is indulged with ease is least athletic. An Indian man is small in
  the hand and wrist for the same reason for which a sailor is large and strong in the
  arms and shoulders, and a porter in the legs and thighs.&#8212; They raise fewer
  children than we do. The causes of this are to be found, not in a difference of nature,
  but of circumstance. The women very frequently attending the men in <span id="page-101"
    class="pagenum">[ 101 ]</span> their parties of war and of hunting, childbearing
  becomes extremely inconvenient to them. It is said, therefore, that they have learnt the
  practice of procuring abortion by the use of some vegetable; and that it even extends to
  prevent conception for a considerable time after. During these parties they are exposed
  to numerous hazards, to excessive exertions, to the greatest extremities of hunger. Even
  at their homes the nation depends for food, through a certain part of every year, on the
  gleanings of the forest: that is, they experience a famine once in every year. With all
  animals, if the female be badly fed, or not fed at all, her young perish: and if both
  male and female be reduced to like want, generation becomes less active, less
  productive. To the obstacles then of want and hazard, which nature has opposed to the
  multiplication of wild animals, for the purpose of restraining their numbers within
  certain bounds, those of labour and of voluntary abortion are added with the Indian. No
  wonder then if they multiply less than we do. Where food is regularly supplied, a single
  farm will shew more of cattle, than a whole country of forests can of buffaloes. The
  same Indian women, when married to white traders, who feed them and their children
  plentifully and regularly, who exempt <span id="page-102" class="pagenum">[ 102 ]</span>
  them from excessive drudgery, who keep them stationary and unexposed to accident,
  produce and raise as many children as the white women. Instances are known, under these
  circumstances, of their rearing a dozen children. An inhuman practice once prevailed in
  this country of making slaves of the Indians. It is a fact well known with us, that the
  Indian women so enslaved produced and raised as numerous families as either the whites
  or blacks among whom they lived.&#8212; It has been said, that Indians have less hair
  than the whites, except on the head. But this is a fact of which fair proof can scarcely
  be had. With them it is disgraceful to be hairy on the body. They say it likens them to
  hogs. They therefore pluck the hair as fast as it appears. But the traders who marry
  their women, and prevail on them to discontinue this practice, say, that nature is the
  same with them as with the whites. Nor, if the fact be true, is the consequence
  necessary which has been drawn from it. Negroes have notoriously less hair than the
  whites; yet they are more ardent. But if cold and moisture be the agents of nature for
  diminishing the races of animals, how comes she all at once to suspend their operation
  as to the physical man of the new world, whom the Count acknowledges to be 'à peu près
  <span id="page-103" class="pagenum">[ 103 ]</span> de mème stature que l'homme de

  influence on his moral faculties? <!--<div id="xw20aab3d696c48" class="marginNote">XVIII.

  contrary to the enlargement of animal nature in this new world, these obstacles to the
  developement and formation of great germs,' been arrested and suspended, so as to permit
  the human body to acquire its just dimensions, and by what inconceivable process has
  their action been directed on his mind alone? To judge of the truth of this, to form a
  just estimate of their genius and mental powers, more facts are wanting, and great
  allowance to be made for those circumstances of their situation which call for a display
  of particular talents only. This done, we shall probably find that they are formed in
  mind as well as in body, on the same module with the * 'Homo sapiens Europæus.' The
  principles of their society forbidding all compulsion, they are to be led to duty and to
  enterprize by personal influence and persuasion. Hence eloquence in council, bravery and
  address in war, become the foundations of all consequence with them. To these
  acquirements all their faculties are directed. Of their bravery and address in war we
  have multiplied proofs, because we have been the <span id="xw20aab3d696c50"

  <span id="page-104" class="pagenum">[ 104 ]</span> subjects on which they were
  exercised. Of their eminence in oratory we have fewer examples, because it is displayed
  chiefly in their own councils. Some, however, we have of very superior lustre. I may
  challenge the whole orations of Demosthenes and Cicero, and of any more eminent orator,
  if Europe has furnished more eminent, to produce a single passage, superior to the
  speech of Logan, <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d696c54" class="editorialTrigger"
  src="editorial.png" /><span id="xw20aab3d696c54" class="addEditorial">Logan (c.
    1723-1809), a Native American orator and warrior. Originally a member of the Cayuga
    nation, he moved to the Ohio territory in the 1760s, at which point he started being
    referred to as a Mingo, as Jefferson calls him here.</span> a Mingo chief, to Lord

    (1730-1809) was the colonial governor of Virginia in April, 1774, when white
    settlers from Virginia attacked and massacred many Mingos, including members of
    Logan's family, in retaliation for Indian attacks that had provoked by settlers'
    encroachment on their territories.</span> when governor of this state. And, as a
  testimony of their talents in this line, I beg leave to introduce it, first stating the
  incidents necessary for understanding it. In the spring of the year 1774, a robbery and
  murder were committed on an inhabitant of the frontiers of Virginia, by two Indians of
  the Shawanee tribe. The neighbouring whites, according to their custom, undertook to
  punish this outrage in a summary way. Col. Cresap, <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d696c58"
  class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span id="xw20aab3d696c58"
    class="addEditorial">Michael Cresap (1742-75) was actually not involved in this
    particular raid, although he had participated in similar events. See the note on
    page 106 about the consequences of Jefferson's claim, which he based on Logan's
    account of events, an account that was contested by Cresap's descendants.</span> a
  man infamous for the many murders he had committed on those much-injured people,
  collected a party, and proceeded down the Kanhaway in quest of vengeance. Unfortunately
  a canoe of women and children, with one man only, was seen coming from the opposite
  shore, unarmed, and unsuspecting an hostile attack from the whites. Cresap and his party
  concealed themselves on the bank of the river, and the moment the <span id="page-105"
    class="pagenum">[ 105 ]</span> canoe reached the shore, singled out their objects,
  and, at one fire, killed every person in it. This happened to be the family of Logan,
  who had long been distinguished as a friend of the whites. This unworthy return provoked
  his vengeance. He accordingly signalized himself in the war which ensued. In the autumn
  of the same year, a decisive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanhaway,
  between the collected forces of the Shawanees, Mingoes, and Delawares, and a detachment
  of the Virginia militia. The Indians were defeated, and sued for peace. Logan however
  disdained to be seen among the suppliants. But, lest the sincerity of a treaty should be
  distrusted, from which so distinguished a chief absented himself, he sent by a messenger
  the following speech to be delivered to Lord Dunmore. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d698">'I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin
  hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him
  not. During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his
  cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen
  pointed as they passed, and said, 'Logan is the friend of white men.' I had even thought
  to have lived with you, but for the injuries of one <span id="page-106" class="pagenum"
    >[ 106 ]</span> man. Col. Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood, and unprovoked,
  murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There runs
  not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for
  revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many: I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my
  country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbour a thought that mine is the
  joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who
  is there to mourn for Logan? &#8212;Not one.' </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d700">Before we condemn the Indians of this continent as wanting genius, we
  must consider that letters have not yet been introduced among them. Were we to compare
  them in their present state with the Europeans North of the Alps, when the Roman arms
  and arts first crossed those mountains, the comparison would be unequal, because, at
  that time, those parts of Europe were swarming with numbers; because numbers produce
  emulation, and multiply the chances of improvement, and one improvement begets another.
  Yet I may safely ask, How many good poets, how many able mathematicians, how many great
  inventors in arts or sciences, had Europe North of the Alps then produced? And it was
  sixteen centuries after this before <span id="page-107" class="pagenum">[ 107 ]</span> a
  Newton could be formed. I do not mean to deny, that there are varieties in the race of
  man, distinguished by their powers both of body and mind. I believe there are, as I see
  to be the case in the races of other animals. I only mean to suggest a doubt, whether
  the bulk and faculties of animals depend on the side of the Atlantic on which their food
  happens to grow, or which furnishes the elements of which they are compounded? Whether
  nature has enlisted herself as a Cis or Trans-Atlantic partisan? I am induced to
  suspect, there has been more eloquence than sound reasoning displayed in support of this
  theory; that it is one of those cases where the judgment has been seduced by a glowing
  pen: and whilst I render every tribute of honor and esteem to the celebrated Zoologist,
  who has added, and is still adding, so many precious things to the treasures of science,
  I must doubt whether in this instance he has not cherished error also, by lending her
  for a moment his vivid imagination and bewitching language. (4) </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d702">So far the Count de Buffon has carried this new theory of the tendency
  of nature to belittle her productions on this side the Atlantic. Its application to the
  race of whites, transplanted from Europe, remained for the Abbé Raynal. 'On doit etre
  etonné (he <span id="page-108" class="pagenum">[ 108 ]</span> says) que l'Amerique n'ait
  pas encore produit un bon poëte, un habile mathematicien, un homme de genie dans un seul
  art, ou une seule science.' <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d702b6" class="editorialTrigger"

    (1713-1796), author of <i id="xw20aab3d702b6b1">Histoire Philosophique et Politique
      des Etablissements et du Commerce des Europeens dans les deus Indes,</i> (1770),
    from which Jefferson draws this quotation: "One has to be astonished that America
    has not yet produced a good poet, a talented mathematician, a man of genius in any
    art, or any science."</span> 7. Hist. Philos. p. 92. ed. Mæstricht. 1774. 'America
  has not yet produced one good poet.' When we shall have existed as a people as long as
  the Greeks did before they produced a Homer, the Romans a Virgil, the French a Racine
  and Voltaire, the English a Shakespeare and Milton, should this reproach be still true,
  we will enquire from what unfriendly causes it has proceeded, that the other countries
  of Europe and quarters of the earth shall not have inscribed any name in the roll of
  poets *. But neither has America produced 'one able mathematician, one man of genius in
  a single art or a single science.' In war we have produced a Washington, whose memory
  will be adored while liberty shall have votaries, whose name will triumph over time, and
  will in future ages assume its just station among the most celebrated worthies of the
  world, <span id="xw20aab3d702b8" class="authorNote">* Has the world as yet produced more
    than two poets, acknowledged to be such by all nations? An Englishman, only, rends
    Milton with delight, an Italian Tasso, a Frenchman the Henriade, a Portuguese
    Camouens: but Homer and Virgil have been the rapture of every age and nation: they
    are read with enthusiasm in their originals by those who can read the originals, and
    in translations by those who cannot.</span>
  <span id="page-109" class="pagenum">[ 109 ]</span> when that wretched philosophy shall
  be forgotten which would have arranged him among the degeneracies of nature. In physics
  we have produced a Franklin, than whom no one of the present age has made more important
  discoveries, nor has enriched philosophy with more, or more ingenious solutions of the
  phænomena of nature. We have supposed Mr. Rittenhouse <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3d702c15" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3d702c15" class="addEditorial">David Rittenhouse (1732-1796), American
    astronomer, and one of the period's most famous American men of science. The
    "mechanical genius" to which Jefferson refers derives from Rittenhouse's
    construction of an "Orrery" (so called after the Earl of Orrery, the patron of the
    Englishman George Graham, who had built one as early as 1704), a mechanical model of
    the planets in orbit around the sun. Rittenhouse's models were more sophisticated
    than the original. In the footnote to this page, Jefferson chafes at using the name
    "Orrery" to describe Rittenhouse's American-built instrument, as he complains about
    the general use of the name "Hadley's quadrant" to describe the navigational
    instrument built by the American Thomas Godfrey at about the same time as that
    constructed by the Englishman John Hadley.</span> second to no astronomer living:
  that in genius he must be the first, because he is self-taught. As an artist he has
  exhibited as great a proof of mechanical genius as the world has ever produced. He has
  not indeed made a world; but he has by imitation approached nearer its Maker than any
  man who has lived from the creation to this day* As in philosophy and war, so in
  government, in oratory, in painting, in the plastic art, we might shew that America,
  though but a child of yesterday, has already given hopeful proofs of genius, as well of
  the nobler kinds, which arouse the best feelings of man, which call him into action,
  which substantiate his freedom, and conduct him to happiness, as of <span
    id="xw20aab3d702c17" class="authorNote">* There are various ways of keeping truth
    out of sight. Mr. Rittenhouse's model of the planetary system has the plagiary
    appellation of an Orrery; and the quadrant invented by Godfrey, an American also,
    and with the aid of which the European nations traverse the globe, is called
    Hadley's quadrant.</span>
  <span id="page-110" class="pagenum">[ 110 ]</span> the subordinate, which serve to amuse
  him only. We therefore suppose, that this reproach is as unjust as it is unkind; and
  that, of the geniuses which adorn the present age, America contributes its full share.
  For comparing it with those countries, where genius is most cultivated, where are the
  most excellent models for art, and scaffoldings for the attainment of science, as France
  and England for instance, we calculate thus. The United States contain three millions of
  inhabitants; France twenty millions; and the British islands ten. We produce a
  Washington, a Franklin, a Rittenhouse. France then should have half a dozen in each of
  these lines, and Great-Britain half that number, equally eminent. It may be true, that
  France has: we are but just becoming acquainted with her, and our acquaintance so far
  gives us high ideas of the genius of her inhabitants. It would be injuring too many of
  them to, name particularly a Voltaire, a Buffon, the constellation of Encyclopedists,
  the Abbé Raynal himself, &amp;c. &amp;c. We therefore have reason to believe she can
  produce her full quota of genius. The present war having so long cut off all
  communication with Great-Britain, we are not able to make a fair estimate of the state
  of science in that country. The spirit in which she wages war is the only <span
    id="page-111" class="pagenum">[ 111 ]</span> sample before our eyes, and that does
  not seem the legitimate offspring either of science or of civilization. The sun of her
  glory is fast descending to the horizon. Her philosophy has crossed the Channel, her
  freedom the Atlantic, and herself seems passing to that awful dissolution, whose issue
  is not given human foresight to scan * . </p>
  <span id="xw20aab3d704" class="authorNote"> * In a later edition of the Abbé Raynal's work,
    he has withdrawn his censure from that part of the new world inhabited by the
    Federo-Americans; but has left it still on the other parts. North America has always
    been more accessible to strangers than South. If he was mistaken then as to the former,
    he may be so as to the latter. The glimmerings which reach us from South America enable
    us only to see that its inhabitants are held under the accumulated pressure of slavery,
    superstition, and ignorance. Whenever they shall be able to rise under this weight, and
    to shew themselves to the rest of the world, they will probably shew they are like the
    rest of the world. We have not yet sufficient evidence that there are more <i

    than in other parts of the earth. As little do we know what would be their operation on
    the mind of man. That country has been visited by Spaniards and Portugueze chiefly, and
    almost exclusively. These, going from a country of the old world remarkably dry in its
    soil and climate, fancied there were more lakes and fogs in South America than in
    Europe. An inhabitant of Ireland, Sweden, or Finland, would have formed the contrary
    opinion. Had South America then been discovered and seated by a people from a fenny

  <p id="xw20aab3d736">To this catalogue of our indigenous animals, I will add a short account
  of an anomaly of nature, taking place sometimes in the race of negroes brought from
  Africa, who, though black themselves, have in rare instances, white children, called
  Albinos. I have known four of these myself, and have faithful accounts of three others.
  The circumstances in which all the individuals agree are these. They are of a pallid
  cadaverous white, untinged with red, without any coloured spots or seams; their hair of
  the same kind of white, short, coarse, and curled as is <span id="page-t-i_16_page_2"
    class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 16, Page 2 ]</span>
  <p> the Bald-coot, or Coot is the Fulica of Linnaeus, &amp; the Foulque of the Encyclop.
  Meth. differing from the description of the latter only in the colour of it's feet
  &amp; legs, which are olive green, without any circle of red, &amp; that of the bill
  a faint carnation, brown at the point, &amp; the membrane on the forehead of a very
  dark purple. It is distinguished from the Gallinula chloropis, Poule d'eau,
  Water-hen, Hydro-gallina, chiefly by the festooned web bordering the toes.</p>
  <span id="page-119" class="pagenum">[ 119 ]</span> that of the negro; all of them well
  formed, strong, healthy, perfect in their senses, except that of sight, and born of
  parents who had no mixture of white blood. Three of these Albinos were sisters, having
  two other full sisters, who were black. The youngest of the three was killed by
  lightning, at twelve years of age. The eldest died at about 27 years of age, in
  child-bed, with her second child. The middle one is now alive in health, and has issue,
  as the eldest had, by a black man, which issue was black. They are uncommonly shrewd,
  quick in their apprehensions and in reply. Their eyes are in a perpetual tremulous
  vibration, very weak, and much affected by the sun: but they see better in the night
  than we do. They are of the property of Col. Skipwith, of Cumberland. The fourth is a
  negro woman, whose parents came from Guinea, and had three other children, who were of
  their own colour. She is freckled, her eye-sight so weak that she is obliged to wear a
  bonnet in the summer; but it is better in the night than day. She had an Albino child by
  a black man. It died at the age of a few weeks. These were the property of Col. Carter,
  of Albemarle. A sixth instance is a woman of the property of a Mr. Butler, near
  Petersburgh. She is stout and robust, has issue a daughter, <span id="page-120"
    class="pagenum">[ 120 ]</span> jet black, by a black man. I am not informed as to
  her eye sight. The seventh instance is of a male belonging to a Mr. Lee, of Cumberland.
  His eyes are tremulous and weak. He is tall of stature, and now advanced in years. He is
  the only male of the Albinos which have come within my information. Whatever be the
  cause of the disease in the skin, or in its colouring matter, which produces this
  change, it seems more incident to the female than male sex. To these I may add the
  mention of a negro man within my own knowledge, born black, and of black parents; on
  whose chin, when a boy, a white spot appeared. This continued to increase till he became
  a man, by which time it had extended over his chin, lips, one cheek, the under jaw and
  neck on that side. It is of the Albino white, without any mixture of red, and has for
  several years been stationary. He is robust and healthy, and the change of colour was
  not accompanied with any sensible disease, either general or topical. </p>

      id="xw20aab3d738b8b1">Historia Naturalis Brasiliae</i> was in Jefferson's

  sting, and is therefore different from the one we have, which resembles perfectly that
  of Europe. The Indians concur with us in the tradition that it was brought from Europe;
  but when, and by whom, we know not. The bees have generally extended themselves into the
  country, a little in advance of the white settlers. The Indians therefore call them the
  white man's fly, and consider their approach as indicating the approach of the
  settlements of the whites. A question here occurs, How far northwardly have these
  insects been found? That they are unknown in Lapland, I infer from Scheffer's
  information, that the Laplanders eat the pine bark, prepared in a certain way, instead
  of those things sweetened with sugar. 'Hoc comedunt pro rebus saccharo conditis.'

  <p id="xw20aab3d785">The rains of every month, (as of January for instance) through the
  whole period of years, were added separately, and an average drawn from them. The
  coolest and warmest point of the same day in each year of the period were added
  separately, and an average of the greatest cold and greatest heat of that day, was
  formed. From the averages of every day in the month, a general average for the whole
  month was formed. The point from which the wind blew was observed two or three times in
  every day. These observations, in the month of January for instance, through the whole
  period amounted to 337. At 73 of these, the wind was from the North; at 47, from the
  Northeast, &amp;c. So that it will be easy to see in what proportion each wind usually
  prevails in each month: or, taking the whole year, the total of observations through the
  whole period having been 3698, it will be observed that 611 of them were from the North,
  558 from the North-east, &amp;c. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d787">Though by this table it appears we have on an average 47 inches of rain
  annually, which is considerably more than usually falls in Europe, yet from the
  information I have collected, I suppose we have a much greater proportion of sunshine
  here than there. Perhaps it will be found there are twice as <span id="page-125"
    class="pagenum">[ 125 ]</span> many cloudy days in the middle parts of Europe, as in
  the United States of America. I mention the middle parts of Europe, because my
  information does not extend to its northern or southern parts. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d789">In an extensive country, it will of course be expected that the climate
  is not the same in all its parts. It is remarkable that, proceeding on the same parallel
  of latitude westwardly, the climate becomes colder in like manner as when you proceed
  northwardly. This continues to be the case till you attain the summit of the Alleghaney,
  which is the highest land between the ocean and the Missisipi. From thence, descending
  in the same latitude to the Missisipi, the change reverses; and, if we may believe
  travellers, it becomes warmer there than it is in the same latitude on the sea side.
  Their testimony is strengthened by the vegetables and animals which subsist and multiply
  there naturally, and do not on our sea coast. Thus Catalpas grow spontaneously on the
  Missisipi, as far as the latitude of 37°. and reeds as far as 38°. Perroquets even
  winter on the Sioto, in the 39th degree of latitude. In the summer of 1779, when the
  thermometer was at 90°. at Monticello, and 96 at Williamsburgh, it was 110°. at
  Kaskaskia. Perhaps the mountain, which overhangs this village on the <span id="page-126"
    class="pagenum">[ 126 ]</span> North side, may, by its reflexion, have contributed
  somewhat to produce this heat. The difference of temperature of the air at the sea
  coast, or on Chesapeak bay, and at the Alleghaney, has not been ascertained; but
  cotemporary observations, made at Williamsburgh; or in its neighbourhood, and at
  Monticello, which is on the most eastern ridge of mountains, called the South West,
  where they are intersected by the Rivanna, have furnished a ratio by which that
  difference may in some degree be conjectured. These observations make the difference
  between Williamsburgh and the nearest mountains, at the position before mentioned, to be
  on an average 6&#8539; degrees of Farenheit's thermometer. Some allowance however is to
  be made for the difference of latitude between these two places, the latter being 38°.
  8'. 17". which is 52'. 22". North of the former. By cotemporary observations of between
  five and six weeks, the averaged and almost unvaried difference of the height of mercury
  in the barometer, at those two places, was .784 of an inch, the atmosphere at Monticello
  being so much the lightest, that is to say, about ¹&#8260;&#8323;&#8327; of its whole
  weight. It should be observed, however, that the hill of Monticello is of 500 feet
  perpendicular height above the river which washes its base. <span id="page-127"
    class="pagenum">[ 127 ]</span> This position being nearly central between our
  northern and southern boundaries, and between the bay and Alleghaney, may be considered
  as furnishing the best average of the temperature of our climate. Williamsburgh is much
  too near the South-eastern corner to give a far idea of our general temperature. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d791">But a more remarkable difference is in the winds which prevail in the
  different parts of the country. The following table exhibits a comparative view of the
  winds prevailing at Williamsburgh, and at Monticello. It is formed by reducing nine
  months observations at Monticello to four principal points, to wit, the North-east,
  South-east, South-west, and North-west; these points being perpendicular to, or parallel
  with our coast, mountains and rivers: and by reducing, in like manner, an equal number
  of observations, to wit, 421. from the preceding table of winds at Williamsburgh, taking
  them proportionably from every point. </p>

  <p id="xw20aab3d795">By this it may be seen that the South-west wind prevails equally at
  both places; that <span id="page-128" class="pagenum">[ 128 ]</span> the North-east is,
  next to this, the principal wind towards the sea coast, and the North-west is the
  predominant wind at the mountains. The difference between these two winds to sensation,
  and in fact, is very great. The North-east is loaded with vapour, insomuch, that the
  salt makers have found that their crystals would not shoot while that blows; it brings a
  distressing chill, is heavy and oppressive to the spirits: the North-west is dry,
  cooling, elastic and animating. The Eastern and South-eastern breezes come on generally
  in the afternoon. They have advanced into the country very sensibly within the memory of
  people now living. They formerly did not penetrate far above Williamsburgh. They are now
  frequent at Richmond, and every now and then reach the mountains. They deposit most of
  their moisture however before they get that far. As the lands become more cleared, it is
  probable they will extend still further westward. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d797">Going out into the open air, in the temperate, and in the warm months
  of the year, we often meet with bodies of warm air, which, passing by us in two or three
  seconds, do not afford time to the most sensible thermometer to seize their temperature.
  Judging from my feelings only, I think they approach the ordinary heat of the human
  body. <span id="page-129" class="pagenum">[ 129 ]</span> Some of them perhaps go a
  little beyond it. They are of about 20 or 30 feet diameter horizontally. Of their height
  we have no experience; but probably they are globular volumes wafted or rolled along
  with the wind. But whence taken, where found, or or how generated? They are not to be
  ascribed to Volcanos, because we have none. They do not happen in the winter when the
  farmers kindle large fires in clearing up their grounds. They are not confined to the
  spring season, when we have fires which traverse whole counties, consuming the leaves
  which have fallen from the trees. And they are too frequent and general to be ascribed
  to accidental fires. I am persuaded their cause must be sought for in the atmosphere
  itself to aid us in which I know but of these constant circumstances; a dry air; a
  temperature as warm at least as that of the spring or autumn; and a moderate current of
  wind. They are most frequent about sun-set; rare in the middle parts of the day; and I
  do not recollect having ever met with them in the morning. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d799">The variation in the weight of our atmosphere, as indicated by the
  barometer, is not equal to two inches of mercury. During twelve months observation at
  Williamsburgh, the extremes were 29, and 30.86 inches, the <span id="page-130"
    class="pagenum">[ 130 ]</span> difference being 1.86 of an inch: and in nine months,
  during which the height of the mercury was noted at Monticello, the extremes were 28.48
  and 29.69 inches, the variation being 1.21 of an inch. A gentleman, who has observed his
  barometer many years, assures me it has never varied two inches. Cotemporary
  observations, made at Monticello and Williamsburgh, proved the variations in the weight
  of air to be simultaneous and corresponding in these two places. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d801">Our changes from heat to cold, and cold to heat, are very sudden and
  great. The mercury in Farenheit's thermometer has been known to descend from 92°. to
  47°. in thirteen hours. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d803">It is taken for granted, that the preceding table of averaged heat will
  not give a false idea on this subject, as it proposes to state only the ordinary heat
  and cold of each month, and not those which are extraordinary. At Williamsburgh in
  August 1766, the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer was at 98°. corresponding with
  29&#8531; of Reaumur. <img id="editorial-xw20aab3d803b1" class="editorialTrigger"
  src="editorial.png" /><span id="xw20aab3d803b1" class="addEditorial">René Antoine
    Ferchault de Reaumur (1683-1757), French naturalist who invented a thermometer with
    a scale in which 0° was the freezing point and 80° the boiling point of
    water.</span> At the same place in January 1780, it was at 6°. corresponding with
  11½ below 0. of Reaumur. I believe * these may be <span id="xw20aab3d803b3"
    class="authorNote">* At Paris, in 1753, the mercury in Reaumur's thermometer was at
    30½ above 0, and in 1776, it was</span>
  <span id="page-131" class="pagenum">[ 131 ]</span> considered to be nearly the extremes
  of heat and cold in that part of the country. The latter may most certainly, as, at that
  time, York river, at York town, was frozen over, so that people walked across it; a
  circumstance which proves it to have been colder than the winter of 1740, 1741, usually
  called the cold winter, when York river did not freeze over at that place. In the same
  season of 1780, Chesapeak bay was solid, from its head to the mouth of Patowmac. At
  Annapolis, where it is 5¼ miles over between the nearest points of land, the ice was
  from 5 to 7 inches thick quite across, so that loaded carriages went over on it. Those,
  our extremes of heat and cold, of 6°. and 98°. were indeed very distressing to us, and
  were thought to put the extent of the human constitution to considerable trial. Yet a
  Siberian would have considered them as scarcely a sensible variation. At Jenniseitz in
  that country, in latitude 58°. 27'. we are told, that the cold in 1735 sunk the mercury
  by Farenheit's scale to 126°. below nothing; and the inhabitants of the same country use
  stove rooms two or three times a week, in which they stay two hours at a time, the <span
    id="xw20aab3d803b7" class="authorNote">at 16 below 0. The extremities of heat and
    cold therefore at Paris, are greater than at Williamsburgh, which is in the hottest
    part of Virginia.</span>

  mercury to 135°. above nothing. Late experiments shew that the human body will exist in
  rooms heated to 140°. of Reaumur, equal to 347°. of Farenheit, and 135°. above boiling
  water. The hottest point of the 24 hours is about four o'clock, P. M. and the dawn of
  day the coldest. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d805">The access of frost in autumn, and its recess in the spring, do not
  seem to depend merely on the degree of cold; much less on the air's being at the
  freezing point. White frosts are frequent when the thermometer is at 47°. have killed
  young plants of Indian corn at 48°. and have been known at 54°. Black frost, and even
  ice, have been produced at 38½°, which is 6½ degrees above the freezing point. That
  other circumstances must be combined with the cold to produce frost, is evident from
  this also, that on the higher parts of mountains, where it is absolutely colder than in
  the plains on which they stand, frosts do not appear so early by a considerable space of
  time in autumn, and go off sooner in the spring, than in the plains. I have known frosts
  so severe as to kill the hiccory trees round about Monticello, and yet not injure the
  tender fruit blossoms then in bloom on the top and higher parts of the mountain; and in

  <p id="xw20aab3d805b6"> * The following observations on heat and cold, as they affect
  the animal body, may not be unacceptable to those who have not paid particular
  attention to the subject. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d805b8">The living body (not like the dead one, which assumes the
  temperature of the surrounding atmosphere) maintains within itself a steady heat of
  about 96°. of Fareheit's thermometer, varying little with the ordinary variations of
  the atmosphere. this heat is principally supplied by respiration. the vital air, or
  oxygen of the atmospheric fluid inhaled, is separated by the lungs from the azotic
  &amp; carbonic parts, and is absorbed by them; the caloric is disengaged, diffused
  thro' the mass of the body, and absorbed from the skin by the external air coming
  into contact with it. if the external air is of a high temperature, it does not take
  up the superfluous heat of the body fast enough, and we complain of too much heat:
  if it is very cold, it absorbs the heat too fast, &amp; produces the sensation of
  cold. to remedy this, we interpose a covering, which acting as a strainer, lets less
  air come into contact with the body, and checks the escape of the vital heat. as the
  atmospheric air becomes colder, more or thicker coverings are used, till no more
  than the requisite portion of heat is conducted from the body. as it would be
  inconvenient in the day to be burthened with a mass of clothing entirely equivalent
  to great degrees of cold, we have resort to fires and warm rooms to correct the
  state of the atmosphere, as a supplement to our clothing. if we have not the
  opportunity, and the cold is excessive, the thinner parts, as the ear, the nose, the
  fingers and toes lose heat till they freeze, and, if the cold be sufficient, the
  whole body is reduced in heat, till death ensues: as sailors experience who escape
  from shipwreck, in winter storms, on desert shores, where no fire can be found. </p>

  <p id="xw20aab3d805c17">Of the substances we use for covering, linen seems the openest
  strainer for admission of air to the body, and the most copious conductor of heat
  from it; and is therefore considered as a cool clothing. cotton obstructs still more
  the passage of both fluids; and wool more than cotton: it is called therefore a
  worse conductor of heat, and warmer clothing. next to this are the furs, and the
  most impermeable of all for heat and air are feathers and down, and especially the
  down of the Eider duck. (Anas mollissima.) hence the insensibility to cold of the
  beasts with shaggy hair, or fine fur, and of the birds in proportion as they are
  provided with down and soft feathers, as the swan, goose, and duck. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d805c19">Among the substances which, as being bad conductors of heat,
  foment and warm the animal body, are the leaves of the Espeletia Frailexon, a plant
  newly discovered by the great naturalist and traveller Baron Humboldt, on the
  mountains of S. America, at the height of 2450. toises above the sea. these leaves
  being furnished abundantly with a soft down, restore immediately to their due warmth
  the hands, feet, or other members benumbed with cold; and collected as a bed,
  protect from death the Indian benighted in those regions of extreme cold. the same
  scientific traveller, by analysis of the air, at different heights on the mountain
  of Chimborazo which he ascended to the height of 3036 toises (546 toises higher than
  had ever been done by man before, and within 224 toises of it's top) found that the
  oxygen being specifically heavier than the azotic part of the atmosphere, it's
  proportion lessened in that ascent 27. or 28. to 19½ hundredth parts. The same
  circumstance had been before observed by Saussure, Pini &amp; Rebout on the high
  mountains of Europe, and must be among the principal causes of the degree in which
  the animal body is affected with cold in situations more or less elevated. </p>

  <p id="xw20aab3d805c29">In addition to the effect of vital air, as the vehicle of animal
  heat, we may note that it is also the immediate cause, or primum mobile of life.
  for, entering by respiration into the air cells of the lungs, divided from those of
  the blood but by a thin membrane, it infuses thro' that a stimulus into the blood,
  which, acting on the irritable fibres of the heart, excites mechanically the action
  and reaction of that muscle. by these the blood is propelled, and received again in
  a course of constant circulation and vital action communicated and maintained thro'
  all the system. intercept vital air from the lungs, the action of the heart ceases
  for want of stimulus, the current of the blood, unaided, yields to the resistance of
  it's channels, all the vital motions are suspended, &amp; body becomes an inanimated
  lump of matter. </p>
  <span id="page-133" class="pagenum">[ 133 ]</span> course of 40 years, during which it
  has been settled, there have been but two instances of a general loss of fruit on it:
  while, in the circumjacent country, the fruit has escaped but twice in the last seven
  years. The plants of tobacco, which grow from the roots of those which have been cut off
  in the summer, are frequently green here at Christmas. This privilege against the frost
  is undoubtedly combined with the want of dew on the mountains. That the dew is very rare
  on their higher parts, I may say with certainty, from 12 years observations, having
  scarcely ever, during that time, seen an unequivocal proof of its existence on them at
  all during summer. Severe frosts in the depth of winter prove that the region of dews
  extends higher in that season than the tops of the mountains: but certainly, in the
  summer season, the vapours, by the time they attain that height, are become so
  attenuated as not to subside and form a dew when the sun retires. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d807">The weavil has not yet ascended the high mountains.</p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d809">A more satisfactory estimate of our climate to some, may perhaps be
  formed, by noting the plants which grow here, subject however to be killed by our
  severest colds. These are the fig, pomegranate, artichoke, <span id="page-134"
    class="pagenum">[ 134 ]</span> and European walnut. In mild winters, lettuce and
  endive require no shelter; but generally they need a slight covering. I do not know that
  the want of long moss, reed, myrtle, swamp laurel, holly and cypress, in the upper
  country, proceeds from a greater degree of cold, nor that they were ever killed with any
  degree of cold in the lower country. The aloe lived in Williamsburgh in the open air
  through the severe winter of 1779, 1780. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d811">A change in our climate however is taking place very sensibly. Both
  heats and colds are become much more moderate within the memory even of the middle-aged.
  Snows are less frequent and less deep. They do not often lie, below the mountains, more
  than one, two, or three days, and very rarely a week. They are remembered to have been
  formerly frequent, deep, and of long continuance. The elderly inform me the earth used
  to be covered with snow about three months in every year. The rivers, which then seldom
  failed to freeze over in the course of the winter, scarcely ever do so now. This change
  has produced an unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold, in the spring of the
  year, which is very fatal to fruits. From the year 1741 to 1769, an interval of
  twenty-eight years, there was no instance of fruit <span id="page-135" class="pagenum">[
    135 ]</span> killed by the frost in the neighbourhood of Monticello. An intense
  cold, produced by constant snows, kept the buds locked up till the sun could obtain, in
  the spring of the year, so fixed an ascendency as to dissolve those snows, and protect
  the buds, during their developement, from every danger of returning cold. The
  accumulated snows of the winter remaining to be dissolved all together in the spring,
  produced those overflowings of our rivers, so frequent then, and so rare now. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3d813">Having had occasion to mention the particular situation of Monticello
  for other purposes, I will just take notice that its elevation affords an opportunity of
  seeing a phænomenon which is rare at land, though frequent at sea. The seamen call it <i
    id="xw20aab3d813b1">looming</i>. Philosophy is as yet in the rear of the seamen, for
  so far from having accounted for it, she has not given it a name. Its principal effect
  is to make distant objects appear larger, in opposition to the general law of vision, by
  which they are diminished. I knew an instance, at York town, from whence the water
  prospect eastwardly is without termination, wherein a canoe with three men, at a great
  distance, was taken for a ship with its three masts. I am little acquainted with the
  phænomenon as it shews <span id="page-136" class="pagenum">[ 136 ]</span> itself at sea;
  but at Monticello it is familiar. There is a solitary mountain about 40 miles off, in
  the South, whose natural shape, as presented to view there, is a regular cone; but, by
  the effect of looming, it sometimes subsides almost totally into the horizon; sometimes
  it rises more acute and more elevated; sometimes it is hemispherical; and sometimes its
  sides are perpendicular, its top flat, and as broad as its base. In short it assumes at
  times the most whimsical shapes, and all these perhaps successively in the same morning.
  The Blue ridge of mountains comes into view, in the North East, at about 100 miles
  distance, and, approaching in a direct line, passes by within 20 miles, and goes off to
  the South-west. This phenomenon begins to shew itself on these mountains, at about 50
  miles distance, and continues beyond that as far as they are seen. I remark no
  particular state, either in the weight, moisture, or heat of the atmosphere, necessary
  to produce this. The only constant circumstances are, its appearance in the morning
  only, and on objects at least 40 or 50 miles distant. In this latter circumstance, if
  not in both, it differs from the looming on the water. Refraction will not account for
  this metamorphosis. That only changes the proportions of length and <span id="page-137"
    class="pagenum">[ 137 ]</span> breadth, base and altitude, preserving the general
  outlines. Thus it may make a circle appear elliptical, raise or depress a cone, but by
  none of its laws, as yet developed, will it make a circle appear a square, or a cone a
  sphere. </p>
