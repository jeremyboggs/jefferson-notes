        year 1624. He was a member of the council, and afterwards president of the colony; and
        to his efforts principally may be ascribed its support against the opposition of the
        natives. He was honest, sensible, and well informed; but his style is barbarous and
        uncouth. His history, however, is almost the only source from which we derive any
        knowledge of the infancy of our state. </p>

        taste in style. He is inelegant, therefore, and his details often too minute to be

            controversy that followed, in which the Virginia legislature argued that the
            colonial administration had no right to impose such taxes on its own authority, was,

        Where the title alone, and not the paper itself, has come under my observation, I cannot
        answer for the exactness of the date. Sometimes I have not been able to find any date at
        all, and sometimes have not been satisfied that such a paper exists. An extensive

        preparation by a * gentleman fully equal to the task, and from whom, therefore, we may

        <p id="xw20aab3e1531">(I.) p. 24. Besides the three channels of communication mentioned
        between the western waters and the Atlantic, there are two others, to which the
        Pennsylvanians are turning their attention; one from Presque-isle, on Lake Erié, to Le
        Boeuf, down the Alleghaney to Kiskiminitas, then up the Kiskiminitas, and from thence,
        by a small portage, to Juniata, which falls into the Susquehanna: the other from Lake
        Ontario to the East Branch of the Delaware, and down that to Philadelphia. Both these
        are said to be very practicable: and, considering the enterprising temper of the
        Pennsylvanians, and particularly of the merchants of Philadelphia, whose object is
        concentered in promoting the commerce and trade of one city, it is not <span
            id="page-334" class="pagenum">[ 334 ]</span> improbable but one or both of these
        communications will be opened and improved. </p>
        <p id="xw20aab3e1533">(2.) p. 28. The reflections I was led into on viewing this passage of
        the Patowmac through the Blue ridge were, that this country must have suffered some
        violent convulsion, and that the face of it must have been changed from what it probably
        was some centuries ago: that the broken and ragged faces of the mountain on each side
        the river; the tremendous rocks, which are left with one end fixed in the precipice, and
        the other jutting out, and seemingly ready to fall for want of support; the bed of the
        river for several miles below obstructed, and filled with the loose stones carried from
        this mound; in short, every thing on which you cast your eye evidently demonstrates a
        disrupture and breach in the mountain, and that, before this happened, what is now a
        fruitful vale, was formerly a great lake or collection of water, which possibly might
        have here formed a mighty cascade, or had its vent to the ocean by the Susquehanna,
        where the Blue ridge seems to terminate. Besides this, there are other parts of this
        country which bear evident traces of a like convulsion. From the best accounts I have
        been able to obtain, the place where the Delaware now flows <span id="page-335"
            class="pagenum">[ 335 ]</span> through the Kittatinny mountain, which is a
        continuation of what is called the North ridge, or mountain, was not its original
        course, but that it passed through what is now called 'the Wind-gap,' a place several
        miles to the westward, and above an hundred feet higher than the present bed of the
        river. This Wind-gap is about a mile broad, and the stones in it such as seem to have
        been washed for ages by water running over them. Should this have been the case, there
        must have been a large lake behind that mountain, and by some uncommon swell in the
        waters, or by some convulsion of nature, the river must have opened its way through a
        different part of the mountain, and meeting there with less obstruction, carried away
        with it the opposing mounds of earth, and deluged the country below with the immense
        collection of waters to which this new passage gave vent. There are still remaining, and
        daily discovered, innumerable instances of such a deluge on both sides of the river,
        after it passed the hills above the falls of Trenton, and reached the champaign. On the
        New-Jersey side, which is flatter than the Pennsylvania side, all the country below
        Croswick hills seems to have been overflowed to the distance of from ten to fifteen
        miles back from the river, and to have acquired a new <span id="page-336"
            class="pagenum">[ 336 ]</span> soil by the earth and clay brought down and mixed
        with the native sand. The spot on which Philadelphia stands evidently appears to be made
        ground. The different strata through which they pass in digging to water, the acorns,
        leaves, and sometimes branches, which are found above twenty feet below the surface, all
        seem to demonstrate this. I am informed that at York town in Virginia, in the bank of
        York river, there are different strata of shells and earth, one above another, which
        seem to point out that the country there has undergone several changes; that the sea
        has, for a succession of ages, occupied the place where dry land now appears; and that
        the ground has been suddenly raised at various periods. What a change would it make in
        the country below, should the mountains at Niagara, by any accident, be cleft asunder,
        and a passage suddenly opened to drain off the waters of Erié and the Upper lakes! While
        ruminating on these subjects, I have often been hurried away by fancy, and led to
        imagine, that what is now the bay of Mexico, was once a champaign country; and that from
        the point or cape of Florida, there was a continued range of mountains through Cuba,
        Hispaniola, Porto rico, Martinique, Guadaloupe, Barbadoes, and Trinidad, till it reached
        the coast <span id="page-337" class="pagenum">[ 337 ]</span> of America, and formed the
        shores which bounded the ocean, and guarded the country behind: that, by some convulsion
        or shock of nature, the sea had broken through these mounds, and deluged that vast
        plain, till it reached the foot of the Andes; that being there heaped up by the
        trade-winds, always blowing from one quarter, it had found its way back, as it continues
        to do, through the gulph between Florida and Cuba, carrying with it the loom and sand it
        may have scooped from the country it had occupied, part of which it may have deposited
        on the shores of North America, and with part formed the banks of
        Newfoundland.&#8212;But these are only the visions of fancy. </p>
        <p id="xw20aab3e1535">[3.] p. 57. There is a plant, or weed, called the * James town weed,
        of a very singular quality. The late Dr. Bond informed me, that he had under his care a
        patient, a young girl, who had put the seeds of this plant into her eye, which dilated
        the pupil to such a degree, that she could see in the dark, but in the light was almost
        blind. The effect that the leaves had when eaten by a ship's crew that arrived at James
        town, are well known &#8224;. </p>

        <p id="xw20aab3e1543">[4.] p. 107. Mons. Buffon has indeed given an afflicting picture of
        human nature in his description of the man of America. But sure I am there never was a
        picture more unlike the original. He grants indeed that his stature is the same as that
        of the man of Europe. He might have admitted, that the Iroquois were larger, and the
        Lenopi, or Delawares, taller than people in Europe generally are. But he says their
        organs of generation are smaller and weaker than those of Europeans. Is this a fact? I
        believe not; at least it is an observation I never heard before.&#8212; 'They have no
        beard.' Had he known the pains and trouble it costs the men to pluck out by the roots
        the hair that grows on their faces, he would have seen that nature had not been
        deficient in that respect. Every nation has its customs. I have seen an Indian beau,
        with a looking-glass in his hand, examining his face for hours together, and plucking
        out by the roots every hair he could discover, with a kind of tweezer made of a piece of
        fine brass wire, that had been twisted round a stick, and which he used with great
        dexterity.&#8212; 'They have no ardour for their female.' It is true, they do not
        indulge those excesses, nor discover that fondness which is customary in Europe; but
        this is not owing to a defect in nature, <span id="page-339" class="pagenum">[ 339
            ]</span> but to manners. Their soul is wholly bent upon war. This is what procures
        them glory among the men, and makes them the admiration of the women. To this they are
        educated from their earliest youth. When they pursue game with ardour, when they bear
        the fatigues of the chase, when they sustain and suffer patiently hunger and cold; it is
        not so much for the sake of the game they pursue, as to convince their parents and the
        council of the nation that they are fit to be enrolled in the number of the warriors.
        The songs of the women, the dance of the warriors, the sage counsel of the chiefs, the
        tales of the old, the triumphal entry of the warriors returning with success from
        battle, and the respect paid to those who distinguish themselves in war and in subduing
        their enemies; in short, every thing they see or hear tends to inspire them with an
        ardent desire for military fame. If a young man were to discover a fondness for women
        before he has been to war, he would become the contempt of the men, and the scorn and
        ridicule of the women. Or were he to indulge himself with a captive taken in war, and
        much more were he to offer violence in order to gratify his lust, he would incur
        indelible disgrace. The seeming frigidity of the men, therefore, is the effect of
        manners, and not a defect of <span id="page-340" class="pagenum">[ 340 ]</span> nature.
        Besides, a celebrated warrior is oftener courted by the females, than he has occasion to
        court: and this is a point of honour which the men aim at. Instances similar to that of
        * Ruth and Boaz are not uncommon among them. For though the women are modest and
        diffident, and so bashful that they seldom lift up their eyes, and scarce ever look a
        man full in the face, yet, being brought up in great subjection, custom and manners
        reconcile them to modes of acting, which, judged of by Europeans, would be deemed
        inconsistent with the rules of female decorum and propriety. I once saw a young widow,
        whose husband, a warrior, had died about eight days before, hastening to finish her
        grief, and who by tearing her hair, beating her breast, and drinking spirits, made the
        tears flow in great abundance, in order that she might grieve much in a short space of
        time, and be married that evening to another young warrior. The manner in which this was
        viewed by the men and women of the tribe, who stood round, silent and solemn spectators
        of the scene, and the indifference with which they answered my <span
            id="xw20aab3e1543b5" class="authorNote">* When Boaz had eaten and drank, and his
            heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and Ruth came
            softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. Ruth iii. 7.</span>
        <span id="page-341" class="pagenum">[ 341 ]</span> question respecting it, convinced me
        that it was no unusual custom. I have known men advanced in years, whose wives were old
        and past child-bearing, take young wives, and have children, though the practice of
        polygamy is not common. Does this savour of frigidity, or want of ardour for the female?
        Neither do they seem to be deficient in natural affection. I have seen both fathers and
        mothers in the deepest affliction, when their children have been dangerously ill; though
        I believe the affection is stronger in the descending than the ascending scale, and
        though custom forbids a father to grieve immoderately for a son slain in battle.&#8212;
        'That they are timorous and cowardly,' is a character with which there is little reason
        to charge them, when we recollect the manner in which the Iroquois met Mons.
        &#8212;&#8212;, who marched into their country; in which the old men, who scorned to
        fly, or to survive the capture of their town, braved death, like the old Romans in the
        time of the Gauls, and in which they soon after revenged themselves by sacking and
        destroying Montreal. But above all, the unshaken fortitude with which they bear the most
        excruciating tortures and death when taken prisoners, ought to exempt them from that
        character. Much less are they to be characterised as a people of <span id="page-342"
            class="pagenum">[ 342 ]</span> no vivacity, and who are excited to action or motion
        only by the calls of hunger and thirst. Their dances in which they so much delight, and
        which to a European would be the most severe exercise, fully contradict this, not to
        mention their fatiguing marches, and the toil they voluntarily and cheerfully undergo in
        their military expeditions. It is true, that when at home, they do not employ themselves
        in labour or the culture of the soil: but this again is the effect of customs and
        manners, which have assigned that to the province of the women. But it is said, they are
        averse to society and a social life. Can any thing be more inapplicable than this to a
        people who always live in towns or clans? Or can they be said to have no 'republique,'
        who conduct all their affairs in national councils, who pride themselves in their
        national character, who consider an insult or injury done to an individual by a stranger
        as done to the whole, and resent it accordingly? In short, this picture is not
        applicable to any nation of Indians I have ever known or heard of in North America. </p>
        <p id="xw20aab3e1545">[5.] pa. 156. As far as I have been able to learn, the country from
        the sea coast to the Alleghaney, and from the most southern <span id="page-343"
            class="pagenum">[ 343 ]</span> waters of James river up to Patuxent river, now in
        the state of Maryland, was occupied by three different nations of Indians, each of which
        spoke a different language, and were under separate and distinct governments. What the
        original or real names of those nations were, I have not been able to learn with
        certainty: but by us they are distinguished by the names of Powhatàns, Mannahòacs, and
        Mònacans, now commonly called Tuscaròras. The Powhatàns, who occupied the country from
        the sea shore up to the falls of the rivers, were a powerful nation, and seem to have
        consisted of seven tribes five on the western and two on the eastern shore. Each of
        these tribes was subdivided into towns, families, or clans, who lived together. All the
        nations of Indians in North America lived in the hunter state, and depended for
        subsistence on hunting, fishing, and the spontaneous fruits of the earth, and a kind of
        grain which was planted and gathered by the women, and is now known by the name of
        Indian corn. Long potatoes, pumpkins of various kinds, and squashes, were also found in
        use among them. They had no flocks, herds, or tamed animals of any kind. Their
        government is a kind of patriarchal confederacy. Every town or family has a chief, who
        is distinguished by <span id="page-344" class="pagenum">[ 344 ]</span> a particular
        title, and whom we commonly call 'Sachem.' The several towns or families that compose a
        tribe, have a chief who presides over it, and the several tribes composing a nation have
        a chief who presides over the whole nation. These chiefs are generally men advanced in
        years, and distinguished by their prudence and abilities in council. The matters which
        merely regard a town or family are settled by the chief and principal men of the town:
        those which regard a tribe, such as the appointment of head warriors or captains, and
        settling differences between different towns and families, are regulated at a meeting or
        council of the chiefs from the several towns; and those which regard the whole nation,
        such as the making war, concluding peace, or forming alliances with the neighbouring
        nations, are deliberated on and determined in a national council composed of the chiefs
        of the tribe, attended by the head warriors and a number of the chiefs from the towns,
        who are his counsellors. In every town there is a council house, where the chief and old
        men of the town assemble, when occasion requires, and consult what is proper to be done.
        Every tribe has a fixed place for the chiefs of the towns to meet and consult on the
        business of the tribe: and in every <span id="page-345" class="pagenum">[ 345 ]</span>
        nation there is what they call the central council house, or central council fire, where
        the chiefs of the several tribes, with the principal warriors, convene to consult and
        determine on their national affairs. When any matter is proposed in the national
        council, it is common for the chiefs of the several tribes to consult thereon apart with
        their counsellors, and, when they have agreed, to deliver the opinion of the tribe at
        the national council: and, as their government seems to rest wholly on persuasion, they
        endeavour, by mutual concessions, to obtain unanimity. Such is the government that still
        subsists among the Indian nations bordering upon the United States. Some historians seem
        to think, that the dignity of office of Sachem was hereditary. But that opinion does not
        appear to be well founded. The Sachem or chief of the tribe seems to be by election. And
        sometimes persons who are strangers, and adopted into the tribe, are promoted to this
        dignity, on account of their abilities. Thus on the arrival of Capt. Smith, the first
        founder of the colony of Virginia, Opechàncanough, who was Sachem or chief of the
        Chickahòminies, one of the tribes of the Powhàtans, is said to have been of another
        tribe, and even of another nation, so that no certain <span id="page-346"
            class="pagenum">[ 346 ]</span> account could be obtained of his origin or descent.
        The chiefs of the nation seem to have been by a rotation among the tribes. Thus when
        Capt. Smith, in the year 1609, questioned Powhàtan (who was the chief of the nation, and
        whose proper name is said to have been Wahunsonacock) respecting the succession, the old
        chief informed him, 'that he was very old and had seen the death of all his people
        thrice* ; that not one of these generations were then living except himself, that he
        must soon die and the succession descend in order to his brothers Opichapàn,
        Opechàncanough, and Catatàugh, and then to his two sisters, and their two daughters. But
        these were appellations designating the tribes in the confederacy. For the persons named
        are not his real brothers, but the chiefs of different <span id="xw20aab3e1545b9"

        Powhatan died, he was succeeded by Opichapàn, and after his decease Opechàncanough
        became chief of the nation. I need only mention another instance to shew that the chiefs
        of the tribes claimed this kindred with the head of the nation. In 1622, when Raleigh
        Crashaw was with Japazàw, the Sachem or chief of the Patowmacs, Opechàncanough, who had
        great power and influence, being the second man in the nation, and next in succession to
        Opichapan, and who was a bitter but secret enemy to the English, and wanted to engage
        his nation in a war with them, sent two baskets of beads to the Patowmac chief, and
        desired him to kill the Englishman that was with him. Japazaw replied, that the English
        were his friends, and Opichapàn his <i id="xw20aab3e1545c13">brother</i>, and that
        therefore there should be no blood shed between them by his means. It is also to be
        observed, that when the English first came over, in all their conferences with any of
        the chiefs, they constantly heard him make mention of his <i id="xw20aab3e1545c15"
            >brother</i>, with whom he must consult, or to whom he referred them, meaning
        thereby either the chief of the nation, or the tribes in confederacy. The Manahòacks are
        said to have been a confederacy of four tribes, and in alliance with the Monacans, in
        the <span id="page-348" class="pagenum">[ 348 ]</span> war which they were carrying on
        against the Powhatans. </p>
        <p id="xw20aab3e1547">To the northward of these there was another powerful nation, which
        occupied the country from the head of the Chesapeak-bay up to the Kittatinney mountain,
        and as far eastward as Connecticut river, comprehending that part of New-York which lies
        between the highlands and the ocean, all the state of New-Jersey, that part of
        Pennsylvania which is watered, below the range of the Kittatinney mountains, by the
        rivers or streams falling into the Delaware, and the county of Newcastle in the state of
        Delaware, as far as Duck creek. It is to be observed, that the nations of Indians
        distinguished their countries one from another by natural boundaries, such as ranges of
        mountains, or streams of water. But as the heads of rivers frequently interlock, or
        approach near to each other, as those who live upon a stream claim the country watered
        by it, they often encroached on each other, and this is a constant source of war between
        the different nations. The nation occupying the tract of country last described, called
        themselves Lenopi. The French writers call them Loups; and among the English they are
        now commonly called Delawares. This nation or confederacy consisted of five tribes,
        <span id="page-349" class="pagenum">[ 349 ]</span> who all spoke one language. 1.
        The Chihohocki, who dwelt on the West side of the river now called Delaware, a name
        which it took from Lord De la War, who put into it on his passage from Virginia in the
        year , but which by the Indians was called Chihohocki. 2. The Wanami, who inhabited the
        country, called New-Jersey, from the Rariton to the sea. 3. The Munsey, who dwelt on the
        upper streams of the Delaware, from the Kittatinney mountains down to the Leheigh or
        western branch of the Delaware. 4. The Wabinga, who are sometimes called River Indians,
        sometimes Mohickanders, and who had their dwelling between the west branch of Delaware
        and Hudson's river, from the Kittatinney ridge down to the Rariton: and 5. The Mahiccon,
        or Mahattan, who occupied Staten island, York island, (which from its being the
        principal seat of their residence was formerly called Mahatton) Long island, and that
        part of New-York and Connecticut which lies between Hudson and Connecticut rivers, from
        the highland, which is a continuation of the Kittatinney ridge down to the sound. This
        nation had a close alliance with the Shawanese, who lived on the Susquehannah and to the
        westward of that river, as far as the Alleghaney mountains, and carried on a <span
            id="page-350" class="pagenum">[ 350 ]</span> long war with another powerful nation
        or confederacy of Indians, which lived to the north of them between the Kittatinney
        mountains, or highlands, and the lake Ontario, and who call themselves Mingos, and are
        called by the French writers Iroquois, by the English the Five Nations, and by the
        Indians to the southward, with whom they were at war, Massawomacs. This war was carrying
        on, in its greatest fury, when Captain Smith first arrived in Virginia. The Mingo
        warriors had penetrated down the Susquehanna to the mouth of it. In one of his
        excursions up the bay, at the mouth of Susquehanna, in 1608, Captain Smith met with six
        or seven of their canoes full of warriors, who were coming to attack their enemies in
        the rear. In an excursion which he had made a few weeks before, up the Rappahanock, and
        in which he had a skirmish with a party of the Manahoacs, and taken a brother of one of
        their chiefs prisoner, he first heard of this nation. For when he asked the prisoner,
        why his nation attacked the English? the prisoner said, because his nation had heard
        that the English came from under the world to take their world from them. Being asked,
        how many worlds he knew? he said, he knew but one, which was under the sky that covered
        him, <span id="page-351" class="pagenum">[ 351 ]</span> and which consisted of the
        Powhatàns, the Mànakins, and the Massawòmacs. Being questioned concerning the latter, he
        said, they dwelt on a great water to the North, that they had many boats, and so many
        men that they waged war with all the rest of the world. The Mingo confederacy then
        consisted of five tribes; three who are called the elder, to wit, the Senecas, who live
        to the West, the Mohawks to the East, and the Onondagas between them; and two who are
        called the younger tribes, namely, the Cayugas, and Oneidas. All these tribes speak one
        language, and were then united in a close confederacy, and occupied the tract of country
        from the East end of lake Erié to lake Champlain, and from the Kittatinney and Highlands
        to the lake Ontario and the river Cadaraqui, or St. Laurence. They had, some time before
        that, carried on a war with a nation, who lived beyond the lakes, and were called
        Adirondacs. In this war they were worsted: but having made a peace with them, through
        the intercession of the French, who were then settling Canada, they turned their arms
        against the Lenopi; and as this war was long and doubtful, they, in the course of it,
        not only exerted their whole force, but put in practice every measure which prudence or
        policy <span id="page-352" class="pagenum">[ 352 ]</span> could devise to bring it to a
        successful issue. For this purpose they bent their course down the Susquehanna, warring
        with the Indians in their way, and having penetrated as far as the mouth of it, they, by
        the terror of their arms, engaged a nation, now known by the name of Nanticocks, Conoys,
        and Tùteloes, and who lived between Chesapeak and Delaware bays, and bordering on the
        tribe of Chihohocki, to enter into an alliance with them. They also formed an alliance
        with the Monakans, and stimulated them to a war with the Lenopi and their confederates.
        At the same time the Mohawks carried on a furious war down the Hudson against the
        Mohiccons and River indians, and compelled them to purchase a temporary and precarious
        peace, by acknowledging them to be their superiors, and paying an annual tribute. The
        Lenopi being surrounded with enemies, and hard pressed, and having lost many of their
        warriors, were at last compelled to sue for peace, which was granted to them on the
        condition that they should put themselves under the protection of the Mingoes, confine
        themselves to raising corn, hunting for the subsistence of their families, and no longer
        have the power of making war. This is what the Indians call making them women. And in
        <span id="page-353" class="pagenum">[ 353 ]</span> this condition the Lenopis were
        when William Penn first arrived and began the settlement of Pennsylvania in 1682. </p>
        <p id="xw20aab3e1549">[6.] Pa. 162. From the figurative language of the Indians, as well as
        from the practice of those we are still acquainted with, it is evident that it was, and
        still continues to be, a constant custom among the Indians to gather up the bones of the
        dead, and deposit them in a particular place. Thus, when they make peace with any
        nation, with whom they have been at war, after burying the hatchet, they take up the
        belt of wampum, and say, 'We now gather up all the bones of those who have been slain,
        and bury them, &amp;c.' See all the treaties of peace. Besides, it is customary when any
        of them die at a distance from home, to bury them, and afterwards to come and take up
        the bones, and carry them home. At a treaty which was held at Lancaster with the six
        nations, one of them died, and was buried in the woods a little distance from the town.
        Some time after a party came and cook up the body, separated the flesh from the bones by
        boiling and scraping them clean, and carried them to be deposited in the sepulchres of
        their ancestors. The operation was so offensive and disagreeable, that <span
            id="page-354" class="pagenum">[ 354 ]</span> nobody could come near them while they
        were performing it. </p>

        by the influence of the French missionaries, have been separated from their nation, and
        induced to settle there. </p>

        Britain, with which the American States were not long since connected, assumed over them
        an authority unwarrantable and oppressive; that they endeavoured to enforce this
        authority by arms, and that the States of New Hampshire, Massachusets, Rhode island,
        Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North
        Carolina, South <span id="page-357" class="pagenum">[ 357 ]</span> Carolina, and
        Georgia, considering resistance, with all its train of horrors, as a lesser evil than
        abject submission, closed in the appeal to arms. It hath pleased the Sovereign Disposer
        of all human events to give to this appeal an issue favourable to the rights of the
        States; to enable them to reject for ever all dependence on a government which had shewn
        itself so capable of abusing the trusts reposed in it; and to obtain from that
        government a solemn and explicit acknowledgment that they are free, sovereign, and
        independant States. During the progress of that war, through which we had to labour for
        the establishment of our rights, the legislature of the commonwealth of Virginia found
        it necessary to make a temporary organization of government for preventing anarchy, and
        pointing our efforts to the two important objects of war against our invaders, and peace
        and happiness among ourselves. But this, like all other their acts of legislation, being
        subject to change by subsequent legislatures, possessing equal powers with themselves,
        it has been thought expedient, that it should receive those amendments which time and

            FREEDOM, passed in the Assembly of Virginia in the beginning of the year
            1786.</i></p>
        <p id="xw20aab3e1733">WELL aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all
        attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens, or by civil
        incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a
        departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who, being Lord both of body
        and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty
        power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as
        ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men have assumed
        dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking
        as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavouring to impose them on others, hath
        established and maintained false religions <span id="page-380" class="pagenum">[ 380
            ]</span> over the greatest part of the world, and through all time; That to compel a
        man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he
        disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that
        teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of
        giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his
        pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is withdrawing
        from the ministry those temporal rewards, which, proceeding from an approbation of their
        personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labours for
        the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious
        opinions, more than on our opinions in physics or geometry; that therefore the
        proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an
        incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or
        renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those
        privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow citizens he has a natural
        right; that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to
        <span id="page-381" class="pagenum">[ 381 ]</span> encourage, by bribing, with a
        monopoly of worldly honors and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform
        to it; that though indeed these are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet
        neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to suffer the civil
        magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the
        profession or propagation of principles, on supposition of their ill tendency, is a
        dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of
        course judge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve
        or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his
        own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its
        officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good
        order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself, that she is
        the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the
        conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument
        and debate, errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict
        them. </p>
