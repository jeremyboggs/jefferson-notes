      and enlarged in the winter of 1782, in answer to Queries proposed to the Author, by
      a Foreigner of Distinction, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3b7b2" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3b7b2" class="addEditorial">Jefferson is referring to François Barbé-Marbois (1745-1837), who was secretary to
         the French legation to the early United States. In 1780, Marbois gave a questionnaire
         to representatives of each of the thirteen states so that he could produce a report
         on the new nation. The questionnaire for Virginia was passed on to Jefferson, who
         took on the project of answering Marbois's queries; <i id="xw20aab3b7b2b1">Notes on the State of Virginia </i> is, ultimately, the product.  In 1803, when Jefferson was President, Marbois negotiated
         the Louisiana Purchase with him.</span> then residing among us. The subjects are all treated imperfectly; some scarcely touched
      on. To apologize for this by developing the circumstances of the time and place of
      their composition, would be to open wounds which have already bled enough. To these
      circumstances some of their imperfections may with truth be ascribed; the great mass
      to the want of information and want of talents in the writer. He had a few copies
      printed, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3b7b4" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3b7b4" class="addEditorial">In 1785, Jefferson had a private edition of 200 copies of <i id="xw20aab3b7b4b1">Notes on the State of Virginia </i>printed in Paris; one of the copies of that printing has been digitized for this edition.
         Another copy was obtained by a French bookseller, who issued a translation of the
         work into French; unhappy with errors that had crept into the text, and worried that
         the book would now be translated back into English (with, very likely, more errors
         produced in that process), Jefferson approached the London publisher John Stockdale
         to issue a new, English edition. Page images of Jefferson&#8217;s own copy of the 1787 London
         edition, which was extensively annotated and amended by him in later years, are also
         included in this edition.</span> which he gave among his friends: and a translation of them has been lately published
      in France, but with such alterations as the laws of the press in that country rendered
      necessary. They are now offered to the public in their original form and language.

   </p> 
   <p id="xw20aab3c25">Virginia is bounded on the East by the Atlantic: on the North by a line of latitude,
      crossing the Eastern Shore through Watkins's Point, being about 37°. 57'. North latitude;
      from thence by a streight line to Cinquac, near the mouth of Patowmac; thence by the
      Patowmac, which is common to Virginia and Maryland, to the first fountain of its northern
      branch; thence by a meridian line, passing through that fountain till it intersects
      a line running East and West, in latitude 390°. 43', 42.4" which divides Maryland
      from Pennsylvania, and which was marked by Messrs. Mason and Dixon <i id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3c25b1" class="addEditorial">Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon had drawn the boundary between Maryland and Virginia
         in the 1760s, creating the famous "Mason-Dixon" line that would distinguish North
         from South by the time of the Civil War.</span>; thence by that line, and a continuation of it westwardly to the completion of five
      degrees of longitude from the eastern boundary of Pennsylvania, in the same latitude,
      and thence by a meridian line to the Ohio: On the West by the Ohio and Missisipi,
      to latitude 36°. 30'. North : and on the South by the line of latitude last-
      <span id="page-2" class="pagenum">[ 2 ]</span>mentioned. By admeasurements through nearly the whole of this last line, and supplying
      the unmeasured parts from good data, the Atlantic and Missisipi, are found in this
      latitude to be 758 miles distant, equal to 13°. 38'. of longitude, reckoning 55 miles
      and 3144 feet to the degree. This being our comprehension of longitude, that of our
      latitude, taken between this and Mason and Dixon's line, is 3°. 13'. 42.4". equal
      to 223.3 miles, supposing a degree of a great circle to be 69 m. 864 f. as computed
      by Cassini <i id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b5" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3c25b5" class="addEditorial">Jacques Cassini (1677-1756) had calculated the precise distance of a degree of latitude.</span>. These boundaries include an area somewhat triangular, of 121525 square miles, whereof
      79650 lie westward of the Allegany mountains, and 57034 westward of the meridian of
      the mouth of the Great Kanhaway <i id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b7" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3c25b7" class="addEditorial">Now more commonly known as the New River.</span>. This state is therefore one third larger than the islands of Great Britain and Ireland,
      which are reckoned at 88357 square miles.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c27">These limits result from, 1. The antient charters from the crown of England. 2. The
      grant of Maryland to the Lord Baltimore, and the subsequent determinations of the
      British court as to the extent of that grant. 3. The grant of Pennsylvania to William
      Penn, and a compact between the general assemblies of the commonwealths of Virginia
      and Pennsylvania as to the extent of that grant. 4. The grant of Carolina, and 
      <span id="page-3" class="pagenum">[ 3 ]</span> actual location of its northern boundary, by consent of both parties. 5. The treaty
      of Paris of 1763. 6. The confirmation of the charters of the neighbouring states by
      the convention of Virginia at the time of constituting their commonwealth. 7. The
      cession made by Virginia to Congress of all the lands to which they had title on the
      North side of the Ohio.

   <h4 id="xw20aab3c29">Query II.</h4>
   <div id="xw20aab3c31" class="marginNote">Rivers and Navigation.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3c33"><i id="xw20aab3c33a">A NOTICE</i> of its rivers, rivulets, and Rivers and navigation and how far they are navigable?
   </p>
   An inspection of a map of Virginia, will give a better idea of the geography of its
   rivers, than any description in writing. Their navigation may be imperfectly noted.
   <p id="xw20aab3c35"><i id="xw20aab3c35a">Roanoke</i>, so far as it lies within this state, is no where navigable, but for canoes, or light
      batteaux; and, even for these, in such detached parcels as to have prevented the inhabitants
      from availing themselves of it at all.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c37"><i id="xw20aab3c37a">James River</i>, and its waters, afford navigation as follows.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c39">The whole of Elizabeth River, the lowest of those which run into James River, is a
      harbour, and would contain upwards of 300 <span id="page-4" class="pagenum">[ 4 ]</span> ships. The channel is from 150 to 200 fathom wide, and at common flood tide, affords
      18 feet water to Norfolk. The Strafford, a 60 gun ship, went there, lightening herself
      to cross the bar at Sowell's point. The Fier Rodrigue, pierced for 64 guns, and carrying
      50, went there without lightening. Craney island, at the mouth of this river, commands
      its channel tolerably well.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c41"><i id="xw20aab3c41a">Nansemond River</i> is navigable to Sleepy hole, for vessels of 250 tons; to Suffolk, for those of 100
      tons; and to Milner's, for those of 25.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c43"><i id="xw20aab3c43a">Pagan Creek</i> affords 8 or 10 feet water to Smithfeild, which admits vessels of 20 ton.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c45"><i id="xw20aab3c45a">Chickahominy</i> has at its mouth a bar, on which is only 12 feet water at common flood tide. Vessels
      passing that, may go 8 miles up the river; those of 10 feet draught may go four miles
      further, and those of six tons burthen, 20 miles further.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c47"><i id="xw20aab3c47a">Appamattox</i> may be navigated as far as Broadways, by any vessel which has crossed Harrison's
      bar in James river; it keeps 8 or 9 feet water a mile or two higher up to Fisher's
      bar, and 4 feet on that and upwards to Petersburgh, where all navigation ceases. 
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c49"><i id="xw20aab3c49a">James River</i> itself affords harbour for vessels of any size in Hampton Road, but not in safety
      through the whole winter; and <span id="page-5" class="pagenum">[ 5 ]</span> there is navigable water for them as far as Mulberry island. A 40 gun ship goes to
      James town, and, lightening herself, may pass to Harrison's bar, on which there is
      only 15 feet water. Vessels of 250 tons may go to Warwick; those of 125 go to Rocket's,
      a mile below Richmond; from thence is about 7 feet water to Richmond; and about the
      center of the town, four feet and a half, where the navigation is interrupted by falls,
      which in a course of six miles, descend about 80 feet perpendicular: above these it
      is resumed in canoes and batteaux, and is prosecuted safely and advantageously to
      within 10 miles of the Blue ridge; and even through the Blue ridge a ton weight has
      been brought; and the expence would not be great, when compared with its object, to
      open a tolerable navigation up Jackson's river and Carpenter's creek, to within 25
      miles of Howard's creek of Green briar, both of which have then water enough to float
      vessels into the Great Kanhaway. In some future state of population, I think it possible,
      that its navigation may also be made to interlock with that of the Patowmac, and through
      that to communicate by a short portage with the Ohio. It is to be noted, that this
      river is called in the maps <i id="xw20aab3c49b4">James River</i>, only to its confluence with the Rivanna; thence to the <span id="page-6" class="pagenum">[ 6 ]</span> Blue ridge it is called the Fluvanna; and thence to its source, Jackson's river.
      But in common speech, it is called James river to its source.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c51">The <i id="xw20aab3c51b1">Rivanna</i>, a branch of James river, is navigable for canoes and batteaux to its intersection
      with the South West mountains, which is about 22 miles; and may easily be opened to
      navigation through those mountains to its fork above Charlottesville.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c53"><i id="xw20aab3c53a">York River</i>, at York town, affords the best harbour in the state for vessels of the largest size.
      The river there narrows to the width of a mile, and is contained within very high
      banks, close under which the vessels may ride. It holds 4 fathom water at high tide
      for 25 miles above York to the mouth of Poropotank, where the river is a mile and
      a half wide, and the channel only 75 fathom, and passing under a high bank. At the
      confluence of <i id="xw20aab3c53b2">Pamunkey</i> and <i id="xw20aab3c53b4">Mattapony</i>, it is reduced to 3 fathom depth, which continues up Pamunkey to Cumberland, where
      the width is 100 yards, and up Mattapony to within two miles of Frazer's ferry, where
      it becomes 2½ fathom deep, and holds that about five miles. Pamunkey is then capable
      of navigation for loaded flats to Brockman's bridge, 50 miles above Hanover town,
      <span id="page-7" class="pagenum">[ 7 ]</span> and Mattapony to Downer's bridge, 70 miles above its mouth.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c55"><i id="xw20aab3c55a">Piankatank</i>, the little rivers making out of <i id="xw20aab3c55b2">Mobjack bay</i> and those of the <i id="xw20aab3c55b4">Eastern Shore</i>, receive only very small vessels, and these can but enter them.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c57"><i id="xw20aab3c57a">Rappahanock</i> affords 4 fathom water to Hobb's hole, and 2 fathom from thence to Fredericksburg.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c59"><i id="xw20aab3c59a">Patowmac</i> is 7½ miles wide at the mouth ; 4½ at Nomony bay; 3 at Aquia; 1½ at Hallooing point;
      1¼ at Alexandria. Its soundings are, 7 fathom at the mouth; 5 at St. George's island;
      4½ at Lower Matchodic ; 3 at Swan's point, and thence up to Alexandria; thence 10
      feet water to the falls, which are 13 miles above Alexandria. These falls are 15 miles
      in length, and of very great descent, and the navigation above them for batteaux and
      canoes, is so much interrupted as to be little used. It is, however, used in a small
      degree up the Cohongoronta branch as far as Fort Cumberland, which was at the mouth
      of Wills's creek: and is capable, at no great expence, of being rendered very practicable.
      The Shenandoah branch interlocks with James river about the Blue ridge, and may perhaps
      in future be opened.
   </p>
   <p><span id="page-8" class="pagenum">[ 8 ]</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c63">The <i id="xw20aab3c63b1">Missisipi</i> will be one of the principal channels of future commerce for the country westward
      of the Alleghaney. From the mouth of this river to where it receives the Ohio, is
      1000 miles by water, but only 500 by land, passing through the Chickasaw country.
      From the mouth of the Ohio to that of the Missouri, is 230 miles by water, and 140
      by land. From thence to the mouth of the Illinois river, is about 25 miles. The Missisipi,
      below the mouth of the Missouri, is always muddy, and abounding with sand bars, which
      frequently change their places. However, it carries 15 feet water to the mouth of
      the Ohio, to which place it is from one and a half to two miles wide, and thence to
      Kaskaskia from one mile to a mile and a quarter wide. Its current is so rapid, that
      it never can be stemmed by the force of the wind alone, acting on sails. Any vessel,
      however, navigated with oars, may come up at any time, and receive much aid from the
      wind. A batteaux passes from the mouth of Ohio to the mouth of Missisipi in three
      weeks, and is from two to three months getting up again. During its floods, which
      are periodical as those of the Nile, the largest vessels may pass down it, if their
      steerage can be ensured. These floods begin in April, and the river returns into its
      banks <span id="page-9" class="pagenum">[ 9 ]</span> early in August. The inundation extends further on the western than eastern side,
      covering the lands in some places for 50 miles from its banks. Above the mouth of
      the Missouri, it becomes much such a river as the Ohio, like it clear; and gentle
      in its current, not quite so wide, the period of its floods nearly the same, but not
      rising to so great a height. The streets of the village at Cohoes are not more than
      10 feet above the ordinary level of the water, and yet were never overflowed. Its
      bed deepens every year. Cohoes, in the memory of many people now living, was insulated
      by every flood of the river. What was the Eastern channel has now become a lake, 9
      miles in length and one in width, into which the river at this day never flows. This
      river yields turtle of a peculiar kind, perch, trout, gar, pike, mullets, herrings,
      carp, spatula fish <i id="editorial-xw20aab3c63b5" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3c63b5" class="addEditorial"><i id="xw20aab3c63b5a">Atractosteus spatula</i>, now commonly known as the Alligator Gar.</span> of 50 lb. weight, cat fish of an hundred pounds weight, buffalo fish, <span id="xw20aab3c63b7" class="addEditorial"><i id="xw20aab3c63b7a">Ictiobus</i>, a common freshwater fish.</span> and sturgeon. Alligators or crocodiles have been seen as high up as the Acansas.<span id="xw20aab3c63b9" class="addEditorial">Arkansas.</span> It also abounds in herons, cranes, ducks, brant, geese, and swans. Its passage is
      commanded by a fort established by this state, five miles below the mouth of Ohio,
      and ten miles above the Carolina boundary.
   </p>
   <p><span id="page-10" class="pagenum">[ 10 ]</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c67">The Missouri, since the treaty of Paris, the Illinois and Northern branches of the
      Ohio since the cession to Congress, are no longer within our limits. Yet having been
      so heretofore, and still opening to us channels of extensive communication with the
      western and north-western country, they shall be noted in their order.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c69">The <i id="xw20aab3c69b1">Missouri</i> is, in fact, the principal river, contributing more to the common stream than does
      the Missisipi, even after its junction with the Illinois. It is remarkably cold, muddy
      and rapid. Its overflowings are considerable. They happen during the months of June
      and July. Their commencement being so much later than those of the Missisipi, would
      induce a belief that the sources of the Missouri are northward of those of the Missisipi,
      unless we suppose that the cold increases again with the ascent of the land from the
      Missisipi westwardly. That this ascent is great, is proved by the rapidity of the
      river. Six miles above the mouth it is brought within the compass of a quarter of
      a mile's width : yet the Spanish Merchants at Pancore <i id="editorial-xw20aab3c69b3" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3c69b3" class="addEditorial">Pancore or Pain Court is now a part of the city of St. Louis, Missouri.</span>, or St. Louis, say they go two thousand miles up it. It heads far westward of the
      Rio Norte, or North River <i id="editorial-xw20aab3c69b5" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3c69b5" class="addEditorial">Now known as the Rio Grande.</span>. There is, in the villages of Kaskaskia, Cohoes and St. Vincennes, no inconsiderable
      quantity of <span id="page-11" class="pagenum">[ 11 ]</span> plate, said to have been plundered during the last war by the Indians from the churches
      and private houses of Santa Fé, on the North River, and brought to these villages
      for sale. From the mouth of Ohio to Santa Fé are forty days journey, or about 1000
      miles. What is the shortest distance between the navigable waters of the Missouri,
      and those of the North River, or how far this is navigable above Santa Fé, I could
      never learn. From Santa Fé to its mouth in the Gulph of Mexico is about 1200 miles.
      The road from New Orleans to Mexico crosses this river at the post of Rio Norte, 800
      miles below Santa Fé: and from this post to New Orleans is about 1200 miles; thus
      making 2000 miles between Santa Fé and New Orleans, passing down the North river,
      Red river and Missisipi; whereas it is 2230 through the Missouri and Missisipi. From
      the same post of Rio Norte, passing near the mines of La Sierra and Laiguana, which
      are between the North river and the river Salina to Sartilla, is 375 miles; and from
      thence, passing the mines of Charcas, Zaccatecas and Potosi, to the city of Mexico
      is 375 miles; in all, 1550 miles from Santa Fé to the city of Mexico. From New Orleans
      to the city of Mexico is about 1950 miles: the roads, after setting out from the Red
      river, near <span id="page-12" class="pagenum">[ 12 ]</span> Natchitoches, keeping generally parallel with the coast, and about two hundred miles
      from it, till it enters the city of Mexico.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c71">The <i id="xw20aab3c71b1">Illinois</i> is a fine river, clear, gentle, and without rapids; insomuch that it is navigable
      for batteaux <i id="editorial-xw20aab3c71b3" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3c71b3" class="addEditorial">A kind of flat-bottomed boat, widely used in this period for navigating rivers.</span> to its source. From thence is a portage of two miles only to the Chickago, which
      affords a batteau navigation of 16 miles to its entrance into lake Michigan. The Illinois,
      about 10 miles above its mouth, is 300 yards wide.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3c73">The <i id="xw20aab3c73b1">Kaskaskia</i> is 100 yards wide at its entrance into the Missisipi, and preserves that breadth
      to the Buffalo plains, 70 miles above. So far also it is navigable for loaded batteaux,
      and perhaps much further. It is not rapid.

   <p id="xw20aab3c75">The <i id="xw20aab3c75b1">Ohio</i> is the most beautiful river on earth. Its current gentle, waters clear, and bosom

   <p id="xw20aab3c97">In common winter and spring tides it affords 15 feet water to Louisville, 10 feet
      to La Tarte's rapids, 40 miles above the mouth of the great Kanhaway, and a sufficiency
      at all times for light batteaux and canoes to Fort Pitt. The rapids are in latitude
      38°. 8'. The inundations of this river begin about the last of March, and subside
      in July. During these a first rate man of war may be carried from Louisville to New
      Orleans, if <span id="page-14" class="pagenum">[ 14 ]</span> the sudden turns of the river and the strength of its current will admit a safe steerage.
      The rapids at Louisville descend about 30 feet in a length of a mile and a half. The
      bed of the river there is a solid rock, and is divided by an island into two branches,
      the southern of which is about 200 yards wide, and is dry four months in the year.
      The bed of the northern branch is worn into channels by the constant course of the
      water, and attrition of the pebble stones carried on with that, so as to be passable
      for batteaux through the greater part of the year. Yet it is thought that the southern
      arm may be the most easily opened for constant navigation. The rise of the waters
      in these rapids does not exceed 10 or 12 feet. A part of this island is so high as
      to have been never overflowed, and to command the settlement at Louisville, which
      is opposite to it. The fort, however, is situated at the head of the falls. The ground
      on the South side rises very gradually.

      of Holston, and 200 yards at Chotee, which is 20 miles above Holston, and 300 miles
      above the mouth of the Tanissee. This river crosses the southern boundary of Virginia,
      58 miles from the Missisipi. Its current is moderate. It is navigable for loaded boats
      of any burthen to the <span id="page-15" class="pagenum">[ 15 ]</span> Muscleshoals, where the river passes through the Cumberland mountain. These shoals
      are 6 or 8 miles long, passable downwards for loaded canoes, but not upwards, unless
      there be a swell in the river. Above these the navigation for loaded canoes and batteaux
      continues to the Long island. This river has its inundations also. Above the Chickamogga
      towns is a whirlpool called the Sucking-pot, which takes in trunks of trees or boats,
      and throws them out again half a mile below. It is avoided by keeping very close to
      the bank, on the South side. There are but a few miles portage between a branch of
      this river and the navigable waters of the river Mobile, which runs into the gulph
      of Mexico.

      boundary about 300 miles from the Missisipi. Cumberland is a very gentle stream, navigable
      for loaded batteaux 800 miles, without interruption; then intervene some rapids of
      15 miles in length, after which it is again navigable 70 miles upwards, which brings
      you within 10 miles of <span id="page-16" class="pagenum">[ 16 ]</span> the Cumberland mountains. It is about 126 yards wide through its whole course, from

      are two small rapids, which give very little obstruction to the navigation. It is
      400 yards wide at the mouth, and navigable 30 leagues upwards for canoes and small
      boats. From the mouth of Maple river to that of Eel river is about 80 miles in a direct
      line, the river continuing navigable, and from one to two hundred yards in width.
      The Eel river is 150 yards wide, and affords at all times navigation for periaguas,
      to within 18 miles of the Miami of the lake. The Wabash, from the mouth of Eel river
      to Little river, a distance of 50 miles direct, is interrupted with frequent rapids
      and shoals, which obstruct the navigation, except in a swell. Little river affords
      navigation during a swell to within 3 miles of the Miami, which thence affords a similar
      navigation into lake Erié, 100 miles distant in a direct line. The Wabash overflows
      periodically in correspondence with the Ohio, and in some places two leagues from
      its banks.

      its great and numerous rapids will admit a navigation, but at an expence to which
      it will require ages to render its inhabitants equal. The great obstacles begin at
      what are called the great falls, 90 miles above the mouth, below which are only five
      or six rapids, and these passable, with some difficulty, even at low water. From the
      falls to the mouth of Greenbriar is 100 miles, and thence to the lead mines 120. It

      day admit a shorter passage from the latter into the Ohio.

   <p id="xw20aab3d133">The <i id="xw20aab3d133b1">Monongahela</i> is 400 yards wide at its mouth. From thence is 12 or 15 miles to the mouth of Yohoganey,
      where it is 300 yards wide. Thence to Redstone by water is 50 miles, by land 30. Then
      to the mouth of Cheat river by water 40 miles, by land 28, the width continuing at
      300 yards, and the navigation good for boats. Thence the width is about 200 yards
      to the western fork, 50 miles higher, and the navigation frequently interrupted by
      rapids; which however with a swell of two or three feet become very passable for boats.
      It then admits light boats, except in dry seasons, 65 miles further to the head of
      Tygarts valley, presenting only some small rapids and falls of one or two feet perpendicular,
      and lessening in its width to 20 <span id="page-20" class="pagenum">[ 20 ]</span> yards. The <i id="xw20aab3d133b5">Western fork</i> is navigable in the winter 10 or 15 miles towards the northern of the Little Kanhaway,
      and will admit a good waggon road to it. The <i id="xw20aab3d133b7">Yohoganey</i> is the principal branch of this river. It passes through the Laurel mountain, about
      30 miles from its mouth; is so far from 300 to 150 yards wide, and the navigation
      much obstructed in dry weather by rapids and shoals. In its passage through the mountain
      it makes very great falls, admitting no navigation for ten miles to the Turkey foot.
      Thence to the great crossing, about 20 miles, it is again navigable, except in dry
      seasons, and at this place is 200 yards wide. The sources of this river are divided
      from those of the Patowmac by the Alleghaney mountain. From the falls, where it intersects
      the Laurel mountain, to Fort Cumberland, the head of the navigation on the Patowmac,
      is 40 miles of very mountainous road. Wills's creek, at the mouth of which was Fort
      Cumberland, is 30 or 40 yards wide, but affords no navigation as yet. <i id="xw20aab3d133b9">Cheat</i> river, another considerable branch of the Monongahela, is 200 yards wide at its mouth,
      and 100 yards at the Dunkard's settlement, 50 miles higher. It is navigable for boats,
      except in dry seasons. The boundary between Virginia and <span id="page-21" class="pagenum">[ 21 ]</span> Pennsylvania crosses it about three or four miles above its mouth. 
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d135">The <i id="xw20aab3d135b1">Alleghaney</i> river, with a slight swell, affords navigation for light batteaux to Venango, at
      the mouth of French creek, where it is 200 yards wide; and it is practised even to
      Le Boeuf, from whence there is a portage of 15 miles to Presque Isle on Lake Erié.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d137">The country watered by the Missisipi and its eastern branches, constitutes five-eighths
      of the United States, two of which five-eighths are occupied by the Ohio and its waters;
      the residuary streams which run into the Gulph of Mexico, the Atlantic, and the St.
      Laurence water, the remaining three-eighths.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d139">Before we quit the subject of the western waters, we will take a view of their principal
      connections with the Atlantic. These are three; the Hudson's river, the Patowmac,
      and the Missisipi itself. Down the last will pass all heavy commodities. But the navigation
      through the Gulph of Mexico is so dangerous, and that up the Missisipi so difficult
      and tedious, that it is thought probable that European merchandize will not return
      through that channel. It is most likely that flour, timber, and other heavy articles
      will be floated on rafts, which will themselves be an article for sale as well as
      their loading, the <span id="page-22" class="pagenum">[ 22 ]</span> navigators returning by land or in light batteaux. There will therefore be a competition
      between the Hudson and Patowmac rivers for the residue of the commerce of all the
      country westward of Lake Erié, on the waters of the lakes, of the Ohio, and upper
      parts of the Missisipi. To go to New-York, that part of the trade which comes from
      the lakes or their waters must first be brought into Lake Erié. Between Lake Superior
      and its waters and Huron are the rapids of St. Mary, which will permit boats to pass,
      but not larger vessels. Lakes Huron and Michigan afford communication with Lake Erié
      by vessels of 8 feet draught. That part of the trade which comes from the waters of
      the Missisipi must pass from them through some portage into the waters of the lakes.
      The portage from the Illinois river into a water of Michigan is of one mile only.
      From the Wabash, Miami, Muskingum, or Alleghaney, are portages into the waters of
      Lake Erié, of from one to fifteen miles. When the commodities are brought into, and
      have passed through Lake Erié, there is between that and Ontario an interruption by
      the falls of Niagara, where the portage is of 8 miles; and between Ontario and the
      Hudson's river are portages at the falls of Onondago, a little above Oswego, of a
      quarter of a mile; from <span id="page-23" class="pagenum">[ 23 ]</span> Wood creek to the Mohawks river two miles; at the little falls of the Mohawks river
      half a mile, and from Schenectady to Albany 16 miles. Besides the increase of expence
      occasioned by frequent change of carriage, there is an increased risk of pillage produced
      by committing merchandize to a greater number of hands successively. The Patowmac
      offers itself under the following circumstances. For the trade of the lakes and their
      waters westward of Lake Erié, when it shall have entered that lake, it must coast
      along its southern shore, on account of the number and excellence of its harbours,
      the northern, though shortest, having few harbours, and these unsafe. Having reached
      Cayahoga, to proceed on to New-York it will have 825 miles and five portages: whereas
      it is but 425 miles to Alexandria, its emporium on the Patowmac, if it turns into
      the Cayahoga, and passes through that, Bigbeaver, Ohio, Yohoganey, (or Monongalia
      and Cheat) and Patowmac, and there are but two portages; the first of which between
      Cayahoga and Beaver may be removed by uniting the sources of these waters, which are
      lakes in the neighbourhood of each other, and in a champaign country; the other from
      the waters of Ohio to Patowmac will be from 15 to 40 miles, according to the trouble
      which shall be taken to approach the two <span id="page-24" class="pagenum">[ 24 ]</span> navigations. For the trade of the Ohio, or that which shall come into it from its
      own waters or the Missisipi, it is nearer through the Patowmac to Alexandria than
      to New-York by 580 miles, and it is interrupted by one portage only. There is another
      circumstance of difference too. The lakes themselves never freeze, but the communications
      between them freeze, and the Hudson's river is itself shut up by the ice three months
      in the year; whereas the channel to the Chesapeak leads directly into a warmer climate.
      The southern parts of it very rarely freeze at all, and whenever the northern do,
      it is so near the sources of the rivers, that the frequent floods to which they are
      there liable break up the ice immediately, so that vessels may pass through the whole

      of a war with our neighbours the Anglo-Americans or the Indians, the route to New-York
      becomes a frontier through almost its whole length, and all commerce through it ceases
      from that moment.&#8212;But the channel to New-York is already known to practice; whereas
      the upper waters of the Ohio and the Patowmac, and the great falls of the latter,

      and scattered confusedly over the face of the country; but that they commence at about
      150 miles from the sea-coast, are disposed in ridges one behind another, running nearly
      parallel with the sea-coast, though rather approaching it as they advance north-eastwardly.
      To the south-west, as the tract of country between the sea-coast and the Mississipi
      becomes narrower, the mountains converge into a single 
      <span id="page-26" class="pagenum">[ 26 ]</span>
 ridge, which, as it approaches the Gulph of Mexico, subsides into plain country,
      and gives rise to some of the waters of that Gulph, and particularly to a river called
      the Apalachicola, probably from the Apalachies, an Indian nation formerly residing
      on it. Hence the mountains giving rise to that river, and seen from its various parts,
      were called the Apalachian mountains, being in fact the end or termination only of
      the great ridges passing through the continent. European geographers however extended
      the name northwardly as far as the mountains extended; some giving it, after their
      separation into different ridges, to the Blue ridge, others to the North mountain,
      others to the Alleghaney, others to the Laurel ridge, as may be seen in their different
      maps. But the fact I believe is, that none of these ridges were ever known by that
      name to the inhabitants, either native or emigrant, but as they saw them so called
      in European maps. In the same direction generally are the veins of lime-stone, coal
      and other minerals hitherto discovered: and so range the falls of our great rivers.
      But the courses of the great rivers are at right angles with these. James and Patowmac
      penetrate through all the ridges of mountains eastward of the Alleghaney; that is
      broken by no watercourse. 
      <span id="page-27" class="pagenum">[ 27 ]</span> It is in fact the spine of the country between the Atlantic on one side, and the
      Missisipi and St. Laurence on the other. The passage of the Patowmac <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d153c13" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d153c13" class="addEditorial">This is present-day Harper's Ferry, West Virginia.</span> through the Blue ridge is perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in nature. You
      stand on a very high point of land. On your right comes up the Shenandoah, having
      ranged along the foot of the mountain an hundred miles to seek a vent. On your left
      approaches the Patowmac, in quest of a passage also. In the moment of their junction
      they rush together against the mountain, rend it asunder, and pass off to the sea.
      The first glance of this scene hurries our senses into the opinion, that this earth
      has been created in time, that the mountains were formed first, that the rivers began
      to flow afterwards, that in this place particularly they have been dammed up by the
      Blue ridge of mountains, and have formed an ocean which filled the whole valley; that
      continuing to rise they have at length broken over at this spot, and have torn the
      mountain down from its summit to its base. The piles of rock on each hand, but particularly
      on the Shenandoah, the evident marks of their disrupture and avulsion from their beds
      by the most powerful agents of nature, corroborate the impression. But the distant
      finishing which nature has given to the 
      <span id="page-28" class="pagenum">[ 28 ]</span>
 picture is of a very different character. It is a true contrast to the fore-ground.
      It is as placid and delightful, as that is wild and tremendous. For the mountain being
      cloven asunder, she presents to your eye, through the cleft, a small catch of smooth
      blue horizon, at an infinite distance in the plain country, inviting you, as it were,
      from the riot and tumult roaring around, to pass through the breach and participate
      of the calm below. Here the eye ultimately composes itself; and that way too the road
      happens actually to lead. You cross the Patowmac above the junction, pass along its
      side through the base of the mountain for three miles, its terrible precipices hanging
      in fragments over you, and within about 20 miles reach Frederic town and the fine
      country round that. This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic. Yet here, as

      of the Missisipi, its summit is doubtless more elevated above the ocean than that
      of any other mountain. But its relative height, compared with the base on which it
      stands, is not so great as that of some others, the country rising behind the successive
      ridges like the steps of stairs. The mountains of the Blue ridge, and of these the
      Peaks of Otter<i id="editorial-xw20aab3d153c50" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d153c50" class="addEditorial">A formation of two mountains in Bedford County, Virginia.</span>, are thought to be of a greater height, measured from their base, than any others
      in our country, and perhaps in North America. From data, which may found a tolerable
      conjecture, we suppose the highest peak to be about 4000 feet perpendicular, which
      is not a fifth part of the height of the mountains of South America, nor one third
      of the height which would be necessary in our latitude to preserve ice in the open
      air unmelted through the year. The ridge of mountains next beyond the Blue ridge,
      called by us the North mountain, is of the greatest extent; for which reason they
      were named by the Indians the Endless mountains.

would of course be led to the mountains which <span id="page-30" class="pagenum">[ 30 ]</span>
  divide the waters of the Mexican Gulph from those of the South Sea; but no volcano
      having ever yet been known at such a distance from the sea, we must rather suppose

      that valley. About three quarters of a mile from its source, it falls over a rock
      200 feet into the valley below. The sheet of water is broken in its breadth by the
      rock in two or three places, but not at all in its height. Between the sheet and rock,
      at the bottom, you may walk across dry. This Cataract will bear no comparison with
      that of Niagara, as to the quantity of water composing it; the sheet being only 12

   <div id="xw20aab3d165" class="marginNote">Madison's cave.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3d167">In the lime-stone country, there are many caverns of very considerable extent. The
      most noted is called Madison's Cave, and is on the North side of the Blue ridge, near
      the intersection of the Rockingham and Augusta line with the South fork of the southern
      river of Shenandoah. It is in a hill of about 200 feet perpendicular height, the ascent
      of which, on one side, is so steep, that you may pitch a biscuit from its summit into
      the river which washes its base. The entrance of the cave is, in this side, about
      two thirds of the way up. It extends into the earth about 300 feet, branching into
      subordinate caverns, sometimes ascending a little, but more generally descending,
      and at length terminates, in two different places, at basons of water of unknown extent,
      and which I should judge to be nearly on a level with the water of the river; however,
      I do not think they are formed by refluent water from that, because they are never
      turbid; because they do not rise and fall in correspondence with that in times of
      flood, or of drought; and because the water is always cool. It is probably one of
      the many reservoirs with which the interior parts of the earth are supposed to

  <span id="page-33" class="pagenum">[ 33 ]</span> abound, and which yield supplies to the fountains of water, distinguished from others
      only by its being accessible. The vault of this cave is of solid lime-stone, from
      20 to 40 or 50 feet high, through which water is continually percolating. This, trickling
      down the sides of the cave, has incrusted them over in the form of elegant drapery;
      and dripping from the top of the vault generates on that, and on the base below, stalactites
      of a conical form, some of which have met and formed massive columns.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d169">Another of these caves is near the North mountain, in the county of Frederick, on
      the lands of Mr. Zane. The entrance into this is on the top of an extensive ridge.
      You descend 30 or 40 feet, as into a well, from whence the cave then extends, nearly
      horizontally, 400 feet into the earth, preserving a breadth of from 20 to 50 feet,
      and a height of from 5 to 12 feet. After entering this cave a few feet, the mercury,
      which in the open air was at 50°. rose to 57°. of Farenheit's thermometer, answering
      to 11°. of Reaumur's, and it continued at that to the remotest parts of the cave.
      The uniform temperature of the cellars of the observatory of Paris, which are 90 feet
      deep, and of all subterranean cavities of any depth, where no chymical agents may
      be supposed 
      <span id="page-34" class="pagenum">[ 34 ]</span>
      to produce a factitious heat, has been found to be 10°. of Reamur, equal to 54½°.
      of Farenheit. The temperature of the cave above-mentioned so nearly corresponds with
      this, that the difference may be ascribed to a difference of instruments.

      pasture, is what is called the <i id="xw20aab3d173b1">Blowing cave</i>. It is in the side of a hill, is of about 100 feet diameter, and emits constantly
      a current of air of such force, as to keep the weeds prostrate to the distance of
      twenty yards before it. This current is strongest in dry frosty weather, and in long
      spells of rain weakest. Regular inspirations and expirations of air, by caverns and
      fissures, have been probably enough accounted for, by supposing them combined with
      intermitting fountains; as they must of course inhale air while their reservoirs are
      emptying themselves, and again emit it while they are filling. But a constant issue
      of air, only varying in its force as the weather is drier or damper, will require
      a new hypothesis. There is another blowing cave in the Cumberland mountain, about
      a mile from where it crosses the Carolina line. All we know of this is, that it is
      not constant, and that a fountain of water issues from it.

      cloven through its length by some great convulsion. The fissure, just at the bridge,
      is, by some admeasurements, 270 feet deep, by others only 205. It is about 45 feet
      wide at the bottom, and 90 feet at the top; this of course determines the length of
      the bridge, and its height from the water. Its breadth in the middle, is about 60
      feet, but more at the ends, and the thickness of the mass at the summit of the arch,
      about 40 feet. A part of this thickness is constituted by a coat of earth, which gives
      growth to many large trees. The residue, with the hill on both sides, is one solid

      of the ellipsis, which would be the cord of the arch, is many times longer than the

      narrow, deep, and straight for a considerable distance above and below the bridge,
      opens a short but very pleasing view of the North mountain on one side, and Blue ridge

      The stream passing under it is called Cedar creek. It is a water of James river, and
      sufficient in the driest seasons to turn a grist-mill, though its fountain is not
      more than two miles above*.

      that this channel has been effected by the wearing of the water which runs through
      it, rather than that the mountain should have been broken open by any convulsion of
      nature. But if it had been worn by the running of water, would not the rocks which
      form the sides, have been worn plane? or if, meeting in some parts with veins of harder
      stone, the water had left prominences on the one side, would not the same cause have
      sometimes, or perhaps generally, occasioned prominences on the other side also? Yet
      Don Ulloa tells us, that on the other side there are always corresponding cavities,
      and that these tally with the prominences so perfectly, that, were the two sides to
      come together, they would fit in all their indentures, without leaving any void. I
      think that this does not resemble the effect of running water, but looks rather as
      if the two sides had parted asunder. The sides of the break, over which is the Natural

   <p id="xw20aab3d218">I knew a single instance of gold found in this state. It was interspersed in small
      specks &#8232;through a lump of ore, of about four pounds &#8232;weight, which yielded seventeen
      penny-weight of gold, of extraordinary ductility. &#8232;This ore was found on the North
      side of &#8232;Rappahanoc, about four miles below the falls. &#8232;I never heard of any other

   <div id="xw20aab3d220" class="marginNote">Lead. </div>
   <p id="xw20aab3d222">On the Great Kanhaway, opposite to the mouth of Cripple creek, and about twenty-five
      miles from our southern boundary, in the county of Montgomery, are mines of lead.
      The metal is mixed, sometimes with earth, and sometimes with rock, which requires
      the force of gunpowder to open it; and is accompanied with a portion of silver, too
      small to be worth separation under any process hitherto attempted there. The proportion
      yielded is from 50 to 80 lb. of pure metal from 100 lb. of washed ore. The most common
      is that of 60 to the 100 lb. The veins are at sometimes most flattering; at others
      they disappear suddenly and totally. They enter the side of the hill, and proceed

         by Don Ulloa in its finest circumstance; no portion in that instance having held together,
         during the separation of the other parts, so as to form a bridge over the Abyss.</span>
      <span id="page-39" class="pagenum">[ 39 ]</span> horizontally. Two of them are wrought at present by the public, the best of which
      is 100 yards under the hill. These would employ about 50 labourers to advantage. We
      have not, however, more than 30 generally, and these cultivate their own corn. They
      have produced 60 tons of lead in the year; but the general quantity is from 20 to
      25 tons. The present furnace is a mile from the ore-bank, and on the opposite side
      of the river. The ore is first waggoned to the river, a quarter of a mile, then laden
      on board of canoes and carried across the river, which is there about 200 yards wide,
      and then again taken into waggons and carried to the furnace. This mode was originally
      adopted, that they might avail themselves of a good situation on a creek, for a pounding
      mill: but it would be easy to have the furnace and pounding mill on the same side
      of the river, which would yield water, without any dam, by a canal of about half a
      mile in length. From the furnace the lead is transported 130 miles along a good road,
      leading through the peaks of Otter to Lynch's ferry, or Winston's, on James river,
      from whence it is carried by water about the same distance to Westham. This land carriage
      may be greatly shortened, by delivering the lead on James river, above the blue ridge,
      from <span id="page-40" class="pagenum">[ 40 ]</span> whence a ton weight has been brought on two canoes. The Great Kanhaway has considerable
      falls in the neighbourhood of the mines. About seven miles below are three falls,
      of three or four feet perpendicular each; and three miles above is a rapid of three
      miles continuance, which has been compared in its descent to the great fall of James
      river. Yet it is the opinion, that they may be laid open for useful navigation, so
      as to reduce very much the portage between the Kanhaway and James river.
   </p> 
   <p id="xw20aab3d224">A valuable lead mine is said to have been lately discovered in Cumberland, below the
      mouth of Red river. The greatest, however, known in the western country, are on the
      Missisipi, extending from the mouth of Rock river 150 miles upwards. These are not
      wrought, the lead used in that country being from the banks on the Spanish side of
      the Missisipi, opposite to Kaskaskia.

   <p id="xw20aab3d228">A mine of copper was once opened in the county of Amherst, on the North side of James
      river, and another in the opposite country, on the South side. However, either from
      bad management or the poverty of the veins, they were discontinued. We are told of
      a rich mine of native copper on the Ouabache, below the upper Wiaw.

   <div id="xw20aab3d232" class="marginNote">Iron.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3d234">The mines of iron worked at present are Callaway's, Ross's, and Ballendine's, on the
      South side of James river; Old's on the North side, in Albemarle; Miller's in Augusta,
      and Zane's in Frederic. These two last are in the valley between the Blue ridge and
      North mountain. Callaway's, Ross's, Millar's, and Zane's, make about 150 tons of bar
      iron each, in the year. Ross's makes also about 1600 tons of pig iron annually; Ballendine's
      1000; Callaway's, Millar's, and Zane's, about 600 each. Besides these, a forge of
      Mr. Hunter's, at Fredericksburgh, makes about 300 tons a year of bar iron, from pigs
      imported from Maryland ; and Taylor's forge on Neapsco of Patowmac, works in the same
      way, but to what extent I am not informed. The indications of iron in other places
      are numerous, and dispersed through all the middle country. The toughness of the cast
      iron of Ross's and Zane's furnaces is very remarkable. Pots and other utensils, cast
      thinner than usual, of this iron, may be fasely thrown into, or out of the waggons
      in which they are transported. Salt-pans made of the same, and no longer wanted for
      that purpose, cannot be broken up, in order to be melted again, unless previously
      drilled in many parts.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d236">In the western country, we are told of iron mines between the Muskingum and Ohio;
      <span id="page-42" class="pagenum">[ 42 ]</span> of others on Kentucky, between the Cumberland and Barren rivers, between Cumberland
      and Tannissee, on Reedy creek, near the Long island, and on Chesnut creek, a branch
      of the Great Kanhaway, near where it crosses the Carolina line. What are called the
      iron banks, on the Missisipi, are believed, by a good judge, to have no iron in them.
      In general, from what is hitherto known of that country, it seems to want iron.

   <p id="xw20aab3d240">Considerable quantities of black lead are taken occasionally for use from Winterham,
      in the county of Amelia. I am not able, however, to give a particular state of the
      mine. There is no work established at it, those who want, going and procuring it for
      themselves.

   <div id="xw20aab3d242" class="marginNote">Pit coal.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3d244">The country on James river, from 15 to 20 miles above Richmond, and for several miles
      northward and southward, is replete with mineral coal of a very excellent quality.
      Being in the hands of many proprietors, pits have been opened, and before the interruption
      of our commerce were worked to an extent equal to the demand.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d246">In the western country coal is known to be in so many places, as to have induced an
      opinion, that the whole tract between the Laurel mountain, Missisipi, and Ohio, yields
      coal. It is also known in many places on 
      <span id="page-43" class="pagenum">[ 43 ]</span> the North side of the Ohio. The coal at Pittsburg is of very superior quality. A
      bed of it at that place has been a-fire since the year 1765. Another coal-hill on
      the Pikerun of Monongahela has been a-fire ten years; yet it has burnt away about
      twenty yards only.

   <p id="xw20aab3d250">I have known one instance of an Emerald found in this country. Amethysts have been

   <div id="xw20aab3d252" class="marginNote">Marble.</div> 	
   <p id="xw20aab3d254">There is very good marble, and in very great abundance, on James river, at the mouth
      of Rockfish. The samples I have seen, were some of them of a white as pure as one
      might expect to find on the surface of the earth: but most of them were variegated
      with red, blue, and purple. None of it has been ever worked. It forms a very large
      precipice, which hangs over a navigable part of the river. It is said there is marble
      at Kentucky.
   </p>
   <div id="xw20aab3d256" class="marginNote">Limestone.</div>	
   <p id="xw20aab3d258">But one vein of lime-stone is known below the Blue ridge. Its first appearance, in
      our country, is in Prince William, two miles below the Pignut ridge of mountains;
      thence it passes on nearly parallel with that, and crosses the Rivanna about five
      miles below it, where it is called the South-west ridge. It then crosses Hardware,
      above the mouth 
      <span id="page-44" class="pagenum">[ 44 ]</span> of Hudson's creek, James river at the mouth of Rockfish, at the marble quarry before
      spoken of, probably runs up that river to where it appears again at Ross's iron-works,
      and so passes off south-westwardly by Flat creek of Otter river. It is never more
      than one hundred yards wide. From the Blue ridge westwardly the whole country seems
      to be founded on a rock of lime-stone, besides infinite quantities on the surface,
      both loose and fixed. This is cut into beds, which range, as the mountains and sea-coast
      do, from south-west to north-east, the lamina of each bed declining from the horizon
      towards a parallelism with the axis of the earth. Being struck with this observation,
      I made, with a quadrant, a great number of trials on the angles of their declination,
      and found them to vary from 22°. to 60°. but averaging all my trials, the result was
      within one-third of a degree of the elevation of the pole or latitude of the place,
      and much the greatest part of them taken separately were little different from that:
      by which it appears, that these lamina are, in the main, parallel with the axis of
      the earth. In some instances, indeed, I found them perpendicular, and even reclining
      the other way: but these were extremely rare, and always attended with signs of convulsion,
      or other circumstances of 
      <span id="page-45" class="pagenum">[ 45 ]</span>
      singularity, which admitted a possibility of removal from their original position.
      These trials were made between Madison's cave and the Patowmac. We hear of lime-stone
      on the Missisipi and Ohio, and in all the mountainous country between the eastern
      and western waters, not on the mountains themselves, but occupying the vallies between
      them.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d260">Near the eastern foot of the North mountain are immense bodies of <i id="xw20aab3d260b1">Schist</i>, containing impressions of shells in a variety of forms. I have received petrified
      shells of very different kinds from the first sources of the Kentucky, which bear
      no resemblance to any I have ever seen on the tide-waters. It is said that shells
      are found in the Andes, in South-America, fifteen thousand feet above the level of
      the ocean. This is considered by many, both of the learned and unlearned, as a proof
      of an universal deluge. To the many considerations opposing this opinion, the following
      may be added. The atmosphere, and all its contents, whether of water, air, or other
      matters, gravitate to the earth; that is to say, they have weight. Experience tells
      us, that the weight of all these together never exceeds that of a column of mercury
      of 31 inches height, which is equal to one of rainwater of 35 feet high. If the whole
      contents 
      <span id="page-46" class="pagenum">[ 46 ]</span>
      of the atmosphere then were water, instead of what they are, it would cover the globe
      but 35 feet deep; but as these waters, as they fell, would run into the seas, the
      superficial measure of which is to that of the dry parts of the globe as two to one,
      the seas would be raised only 52 ½ feet above their present level, and of course would
      overflow the lands to that height only. In Virginia this would be a very small proportion
      even of the champaign country, the banks of our tide-waters being frequently, if not
      generally, of a greater height. Deluges beyond this extent then, as for instance,
      to the North mountain or to Kentucky, seem out of the laws of nature. But within it
      they may have taken place to a greater or less degree, in proportion to the combination
      of natural causes which may be supposed to have produced them. History renders probable
      some instances of a partial deluge in the country lying round the Mediterranean sea.
      It has been often * supposed, and is not unlikely, that that sea was once a lake.
      While such, let us admit an extraordinary collection of the waters of the atmosphere
      from the other parts of the globe to have been discharged over that and the countries
      whose waters run into it. Or without supposing it a lake, admit 
      <span id="xw20aab3d260b9" class="authorNote">* 2.

<span id="page-47" class="pagenum">[ 47 ]</span>
      such an extraordinary collection of the waters of the atmosphere, and an influx of
      waters from the Atlantic ocean, forced by long continued Western winds. That lake,
      or that sea, may thus have been so raised as to overflow the low lands adjacent to
      it, as those of Egypt and Armenia, which, according to a tradition of the Egyptians
      and Hebrews, were overflowed about 2300 years before the Christian æra; those of Attica,
      said to have been overflowed in the time of Ogyges <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d260c16" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d260c16" class="addEditorial">A mythical ruler in ancient Greece.</span>, about 500 years later; and those of Thessaly, in the time of Deucalion <span id="xw20aab3d260c18" class="addEditorial">Another mythical ruler of ancient Greece, the son of Prometheus.</span>, still 300 years posterior. But such deluges as these will not account for the shells
      found in the higher lands. A second opinion has been entertained, which is, that,
      in times anterior to the records either of history or tradition, the bed of the ocean,
      the principal residence of the shelled tribe, has, by some great convulsion of nature,
      been heaved to the heights at which we now find shells and other remains of marine
      animals. The favourers of this opinion do well to suppose the great events on which
      it rests to have taken place beyond all the æras of history; for within these, certainly
      none such are to be found: and we may venture to say further, that no fact has taken
      place, either in our own days, or in the thousands of years recorded in history, which
      proves the existence 
<span id="page-48" class="pagenum">[ 48 ]</span>
 of any natural agents, within or without the bowels of the earth, of force sufficient
      to heave, to the height of 15,000 feet, such masses as the Andes. The difference between
      the power necessary to produce such an effect, and that which shuffled together the
      different parts of Calabria in our days, is so immense, that, from the existence of
      the latter we are not authorised to infer that of the former.

   <p id="xw20aab3d262">M. de Voltaire <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d262b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d262b1" class="addEditorial">Jefferson is referring to the article on shells in Voltaire's <i id="xw20aab3d262b1b1">Questions sur L'Encyclopédie</i> (1770-72).</span> has suggested a third solution of this difficulty (Quest. encycl. Coquilles). He
      cites an instance in Touraine, where, in the space of 80 years, a particular spot
      of earth had been twice metamorphosed into soft stone, which had become hard when
      employed in building. In this stone shells of various kinds were produced, discoverable
      at first only with the microscope, but afterwards growing with the stone. From this
      fact, I suppose, he would have us infer, that, besides the usual process for generating
      shells by the elaboration of earth and water in animal vessels, nature may have provided
      an equivalent operation, by passing the same materials through the pores of calcareous
      earths and stones: as we see calcareous dropstones generating every day by the percolation
      of water through lime-stone, and new marble forming in the quarries from which <span id="page-49" class="pagenum">[ 49 ]</span> the old has been taken out; and it might be asked, whether it is more difficult for
      nature to shoot the calcareous juice into the form of a shell, than other juices into
      the forms of chrystals, plants, animals, according to the construction of the vessels
      through which they pass? There is a wonder somewhere. Is it greatest on this branch
      of the dilemma; on that which supposes the existence of a power, of which we have
      no evidence in any other case; or on the first, which requires us to believe the creation
      of a body of water, and its subsequent annihilation? The establishment of the instance,
      cited by M. de Voltaire, of the growth of shells unattached to animal bodies, would
      have been that of his theory. But he has not established it. He has not even left
      it on ground so respectable as to have rendered it an object of enquiry to the literati
      of his own country. Abandoning this fact, therefore, the three hypotheses are equally
      unsatisfactory; and we must be contented to acknowledge, that this great phænomenon
      is as yet unsolved. Ignorance is preferable to error; and he is less remote from the
      truth who believes nothing, than he who believes what is wrong.

   <div id="xw20aab3d264" class="marginNote">Stone.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3d266">There is great abundance (more especially when you approach the mountains) of stone,
      white, blue, brown, &amp; fit for the chissel, <span id="page-50" class="pagenum">[ 50 ]</span> good mill-stone, such also as stands the fire, and slate-stone. We are told of flint,
      fit for gun-flints, on the Meherrin in Brunswic, on the Missisipi between the mouth
      of Ohio and Kaskaskia, and on others of the western waters. Isinglass or mica is in
      several places; loadstone also, and an Asbestos of a ligneous texture, is sometimes
      to be met with.

   <div id="xw20aab3d268" class="marginNote">Earths.</div> 	 
   <p id="xw20aab3d270">Marle abounds generally. A clay, of which, like the Sturbridge in England, bricks
      are made, which will resist long the violent action of fire, has been found on Tuckahoe
      creek of James river, and no doubt will be found in other places. Chalk is said to
      be in Botetourt and Bedford. In the latter county is some earth, believed to be Gypseous.
      Ochres are found in various parts.

   <div id="xw20aab3d272" class="marginNote">Nitre.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3d274">In the lime-stone country are many caves, the earthy floors of which are impregnated
      with nitre. On Rich creek, a branch of the Great Kanhaway, about 60 miles below the
      lead mines, is a very large one, about 20 yards wide, and entering a hill a quarter
      or half a mile. The vault is of rock, from 9 to 15 or 20 feet above the floor. A Mr.
      Lynch, who gives me this account, undertook to extract the nitre. Besides a coat of
      the salt which had formed on the vault and floor, he found the earth highly impregnated
      to the depth of seven feet in some places, and <span id="page-51" class="pagenum">[ 51 ]</span> generally of three, every bushel yielding on an average three pounds of nitre. Mr.
      Lynch having made about 10,000 lb. of the salt from it, consigned it to some others,
      who have since made 10,000 lb. They have done this by pursuing the cave into the hill,
      never trying a second time the earth they have once exhausted, to see how far or soon
      it receives another impregnation. At least fifty of these caves are worked on the
      Greenbriar. There are many of them known on Cumberland river.
   </p>
   <div id="xw20aab3d276" class="marginNote">Salt.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3d278">The country westward of the Alleghaney abounds with springs of common salt. The most
      remarkable we have heard of are at Bullet's lick, the Big bones, the Blue licks, and
      on the North fork of Holston. The area of Bullet's lick is of many acres. Digging
      the earth to the depth of three feet, the water begins to boil up, and the deeper
      you go, and the drier the weather, the stronger is the brine. A thousand gallons of
      water yield from a bushel to a bushel and a half of salt, which is about 80 lb. of
      water to one lb. of salt;  but of sea-water 25 1b. yield one lb. of salt. So that
      sea-water is more than three times as strong as that of these springs. A salt spring
      has been lately discovered at the Turkey foot on Yohogany, by which river it is overflowed,
      except at very low water.

   <div id="xw20aab3d280" class="marginNote">Medicinal springs.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3d282">There are several Medicinal springs, some of which are indubitably efficacious, while
      others seem to owe their reputation as much to fancy, and change of air and regimen,
      as to their real virtues. None of them having undergone a chemical analysis in skilful
      hands, nor been so far the subject of observations as to have produced a reduction
      into classes of the disorders which they relieve, it is in my power to give little
      more than an enumeration of them.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d284">The most efficacious of these are two springs in Augusta, near the first sources of
      James river, where it is called Jackson's river. They rise near the foot of the ridge
      of mountains, generally called the Warm spring mountain, but in the maps Jackson's
      mountains. The one is distinguished by the name of the Warm spring, and the other
      of the Hot spring <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d284b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d284b1" class="addEditorial">Warm Springs and Hot Springs, in Bath County, Virginia. Jefferson visited here in
         1818, using a (still-standing) pool house that was built in 1761; the waters are now
         referred to as the Jefferson Pools.</span>. The Warm spring issues with a very bold stream, sufficient to work a grist-mill,
      and to keep the waters of its bason, which is 30 feet in diameter, at the vital warmth,
      viz. 96°. of Farenheit's thermometer. The <span id="page-53" class="pagenum">[ 53 ]</span> matter with which these waters is allied is very volatile; its smell indicates it
      to be sulphureous, as also does the circumstance of its turning silver black. They
      relieve rheumatisms. Other complaints also of very different natures have been removed
      or lessened by them. It rains here four or five days in every week.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d286">The <i id="xw20aab3d286b1">Hot spring</i> is about six miles from the Warm, is much smaller, and has been so hot as to have
      boiled an egg. Some believe its degree of heat to be lessened. It raises the mercury
      in Farenheit's thermometer to 112 degrees, which is fever heat. It sometimes relieves
      where the Warm spring fails. A fountain of common water, issuing within a few inches
      of its margin, gives it a singular appearance. Comparing the temperature of these
      with that of the Hot springs of Kamschatka, of which Krachininnikow <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d286b3" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d286b3" class="addEditorial">Stepan Kracheninnikov (1713-55), a Russian explorer and naturalist whose <i id="xw20aab3d286b3b1">Histoire de Kamtchatka et des Contrées Voisines</i>(1767) described eastern Siberia.</span> gives an account, the difference is very great, the latter raising the mercury to
      200°. which is within 12°. of boiling water. These springs are very much resorted
      to in spite of a total want of accommodation for the sick. Their waters are strongest
      in the hottest months, which occasions their being visited in July and August principally.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d288">The Sweet springs are in the county of Botetourt, at the eastern foot of the <span id="page-54" class="pagenum">[ 54 ]</span> Alleghaney, about 42 miles from the Warm springs. They are still less known. Having
      been found to relieve cases in which the others had been ineffectually tried, it is
      probable their composition is different. They are different also in their temperature,
      being as cold as common water: which is not mentioned, however, as a proof of a distinct
      impregnation. This is among the first sources of James river.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d290">On Patowmac river, in Berkeley county, above the North mountain, are Medicinal springs,
      much more frequented than those of Augusta. Their powers, however, are less, the waters
      weakly mineralized, and scarcely warm. They are more visited, because situated in
      a fertile, plentiful, and populous country, better provided with accommodations, always
      safe from the Indians, and nearest to the more populous states.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d292">In Louisa county, on the head waters of the South Anna branch of York river, are springs
      of some medicinal virtue. They are not much used however. There is a weak chalybeate

   <div id="xw20aab3d302" class="marginNote">Burning spring.</div>													
   <p id="xw20aab3d304">In the low grounds of the Great Kanhaway, 7 miles above the mouth of Elk river, and
      67 above that of the Kanhaway itself, is a hole in the earth of the capacity of 30
      or 40 gallons, from which issues constantly a bituminous vapour in so strong a current,
      as to give to the sand about its orifice the motion which it has in a boiling spring.
      On presenting a lighted candle or torch within 18 inches of the hole, it flames up
      in a column of 18 inches diameter, and four or five feet height, which sometimes burns
      out within 20 minutes, and at other times has been known to continue three days, and
      then has been left still burning. The flame is unsteady, of the density of that of
      burning spirits, and smells like burning pit coal. Water sometimes collects in the
      bason, which is remarkably cold, and is kept in ebullition by the vapour issuing through
      it. If the vapour be fired in that state, the water soon becomes so warm that the
      hand cannot bear it, and evaporates wholly in a short time. This, with the circumjacent
      lands, is the property of his Excellency General Washington and of General Lewis <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d304b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d304b1" class="addEditorial">Andrew Lewis (1720-81) had been a soldier during both the French and Indian and Revolutionary

   <p id="xw20aab3d306">There is a similar one on Sandy river, the flame of which is a column of about 12

   <div id="xw20aab3d308" class="marginNote">Syphon fountains.</div>		
   <p id="xw20aab3d310">The mention of uncommon springs leads me to that of Syphon fountains. There is one
      of these near the intersection of the Lord Fairfax's boundary with the North mountain,
      not far from Brock's gap, on the stream of which is a grist-mill, which grinds two
      bushel of grain at every flood of the spring. Another, near the Cow-pasture river,
      a mile and a half below its confluence with the Bull-pasture river, and 16 or 17 miles
      from the Hot springs, which intermits once in every twelve hours. One also near the
      mouth of the North Holston.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d312">After these may be mentioned the <i id="xw20aab3d312b1">Natural Well</i>, on the lands of a Mr. Lewis in Frederick county. It is somewhat larger than a common
      well: the water rises in it as near the surface of the earth as in the neighbouring
      artificial wells, and is of a depth as yet unknown. It is said there is a current
      in it tending sensibly downwards. If this be true, it probably feeds some fountain,
      of which it is the natural reservoir, distinguished from others, like that of Madison's
      cave, by being accessible. It is used with a bucket and windlass as an ordinary well.

    <p id="xw20aab3d316b6">We are told that during a great storm on the 25<i id="xw20aab3d316b6b1">th</i>. of Dec. 1798. the Syphon fountain, near the mouth of the North Holston ceased, and
    a spring broke out about 100. feet higher up the hill. Syphon fountains have been
    explained by supposing the duct which leads from the reservoir to the surface of the
    earth to be in the form of a syphon a. b. c. where it is evident that till the water
    rises in the reservoir to d the level of the highest point of the syphon, it cannot
    flow through the duct, &amp; it is known that when once it begins to flow it will draw
    off the water of the reservoir to the orifice a. of the syphon if the duct be larger
    than the supply of the reservoir. possibly the force of the waters &amp; loosening of
    the earth by them, during the storm abovementioned may have opened a more direct duct
    as from e. to f. horizontally or declining, which issued higher up the hill than the
    one fed by the syphon. In that case it becomes a common spring. should this duct be
    again closed or diminished by any new accident the syphon may begin to play again,
    and both springs be kept in action from the same reservoir.

   <p id="xw20aab3d634">Our quadrupeds have been mostly described by Linnæus and Mons. de Buffon. Of these
      the Mammoth, or big buffalo, as called by the Indians, must certainly have been the
      largest. Their tradition is, that he was carnivorous, and still exists in the northern
      parts of America. A delegation of warriors from the Delaware tribe having visited
      the governor of Virginia <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d634b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d634b1" class="addEditorial">That would be Jefferson himself, who served as governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, at the time when this incident would have taken place. Jefferson's desire to show that mammoths survived into historical memory serves the purpose of refuting Buffon's claim that animals and plants degenerated in the climate of the New World. By offering evidence (which we now know to be incorrect) that large animals like mammoths--larger than anything found in Europe--existed recently and may still exist in the Americas, Jefferson hoped to refute Buffon and argue for the fertility and fecundity of his native land. Indeed, for much of this Query, the vast amount of evidence that Jefferson offers for the variety of plants, animals, and minerals present in Virginia, and in particular the size of its larger animals, while it may run the risk of seeming like overkill to the modern reader, is designed to serve as a kind of argument-by-sheer-quantity against Buffon's influential writings.</span>, during the present revolution, on matters of business, after these had been discussed
      and settled in council, the governor asked them some questions relative to their country,
      and, among others, what they knew or had heard of the animal whose bones were found
      at the Saltlicks, on the Ohio. Their chief speaker immediately put himself into an
      attitude of oratory, and with a pomp suited to what he conceived the elevation of
      his subject, informed him that it was a tradition handed down from their fathers,
      'That in antient times a herd of these tremendous animals came to the Big-bone licks,
      and began an universal destruction of the bear, deer, elks, buffaloes, and other animals,
      <span id="page-65" class="pagenum">[ 65 ]</span> which had been created for the use of the Indians: that the Great Man above, looking
      down and seeing this, was so enraged that he seized his lightning, descended on the
      earth, seated himself on a neighbouring mountain, on a rock, of which his seat and
      the print of his feet are still to be seen, and hurled his bolts among them till the
      whole were slaughtered, except the big bull, who presenting his forehead to the shafts,
      shook them off as they fell; but missing one at length, it wounded him in the side;
      whereon, springing round, he bounded over the Ohio, over the Wabash, the Illinois,
      and finally over the great lakes, where he is living at this day.' It is well known
      that on the Ohio, and in many parts of America further north, tusks, grinders, and
      skeletons of unparalleled magnitude, are found in great numbers, some lying on the
      surface of the earth, and some a little below it. A Mr. Stanley, taken prisoner by
      the Indians near the mouth of the Tanissee, relates, that, after being transferred
      through several tribes, from one to another, he was at length carried over the mountains
      west of the Missouri to a river which runs westwardly; that these bones abounded there;
      and that the natives described to him the animal to which they belonged as still existing
      in the 
      <span id="page-66" class="pagenum">[ 66 ]</span>
 northern parts of their country; from which description he judged it to be an elephant.
      Bones of the same kind have been lately found, some feet below the surface of the
      earth, in salines opened on the North Holston, a branch of the Tanissee, about the
      latitude of 36½°. North. From the accounts published in Europe, I suppose it to be
      decided, that these are of the same kind with those found in Siberia. Instances are
      mentioned of like animal remains found in the more southern climates of both hemispheres;
      but they are either so loosely mentioned as to leave a doubt of the fact, so inaccurately
      described as not to authorize the classing them with the great northern bones, or
      so rare as to found a suspicion that they have been carried thither as curiosities
      from more northern regions. So that on the whole there seem to be no certain vestiges
      of the existence of this animal further south than the salines last mentioned. It
      is remarkable that the tusks and skeletons have been ascribed by the naturalists of
      Europe to the elephant, while the grinders have been given to the hippopotamus, or
      riverhorse. Yet it is acknowledged, that the tusks and skeletons are much larger than
      those of the elephant, and the grinders many times greater than those of the hippopotamus,
      and essentially different in form. Wherever these grinders are found, there also we
      find 
<span id="page-67" class="pagenum">[ 67 ]</span>
 the tusks and skeleton; but no skeleton of the hippopotamus nor grinders of the elephant.
      It will not be said that the hippopotamus and elephant came always to the same spot,
      the former to deposit his grinders, and the latter his tusks and skeleton. For what
      became of the parts not deposited there? We must agree then that these remains belong
      to each other, that they are of one and the same animal, that this was not a hippopotamus,
      because the hippopotamus had no tusks nor such a frame, and because the grinders differ
      in their size as well as in the number and form of their points. That it was not an
      elephant, I think ascertained by proofs equally decisive. I will not avail myself
      of the authority of the celebrated * 
      anatomist, who, from an examination of the form and structure of the tusks, has declared
      they were essentially different from those of the elephant; because another &#8224; anatomist,
      equally celebrated, has declared, on a like examination, that they are precisely the
      same. Between two such authorities I will suppose this circumstance equivocal. But,
      1. The skeleton of the mammoth (for so the incognitum has been called) bespeaks an
      animal of five or six times the cubic volume of the elephant, as Mons. de Buffon has
      admitted. 2. The grinders are five times as

      <span id="page-68" class="pagenum">[ 68 ]</span> large, are square, and the grinding surface studded with four or five rows of blunt
      points: whereas those of the elephant are broad and thin, and their grinding surface
      flat. 3. I have never heard an instance, and suppose there has been none, of the grinder
      of an elephant being found in America. 4. From the known temperature and constitution
      of the elephant he could never have existed in those regions where the remains of
      the mammoth have been found. The elephant is a native only of the torrid zone and
      its vicinities: if, with the assistance of warm apartments and warm clothing, he has
      been preserved in life in the temperate climates of Europe, it has only been for a
      small portion of what would have been his natural period, and no instance of his multiplication
      in them has ever been known. But no bones of the mammoth, as I have before observed,
      have been ever found further south than the salines of the Holston, and they have
      been found as far north as the Arctic circle. Those, therefore, who are of opinion
      that the elephant and mammoth are the same, must believe, 1. That the elephant known
      to us can exist and multiply in the frozen zone; or, 2. That an internal fire may
      once have warmed those regions, and since abandoned them, of which, however, the globe
      exhibits no unequivocal indications; or, 
<span id="page-t-i_15_page_1" class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 15, Page 1 ]</span>
    <p>pa. 69. line 6. subjoin this note.</p>
    <p>M. de Buffon considers the existence of Elephant bones in Northern regions, where
    the animal itself is no longer found, as one of the leading facts which support his
    theory that the earth was once in a liquid state, rendered so by the action of fire,
    that the process of cooling began at its poles, and proceeded gradually towards the
    torrid zone, that with this progress the animals of warm temperature retired towards
    the equator, and that in the present state of that progress the globe remains of sufficient
    warmth, for the elephant for instance, in the tropical regions, only to which therefore
    they have retired, as their last asylum and where they must become extinct when the
    degree of warmth shall be reduced below that adapted to their constitution. how does
    it happen then that no elephants exist at present in the tropical regions of America,
    to which those of the Ohio must have retired, according to this theory.</p>
      <span id="page-69" class="pagenum">[ 69 ]</span>3. That the obliquity of the ecliptic, when these elephants lived, was so great as
      to include within the tropics all those regions in which the bones are found; the
      tropics being, as is before observed, the natural limits of habitation for the elephant.
      But if it be admitted that this obliquity has really decreased, and we adopt the highest
      rate of decrease yet pretended, that is, of one minute in a century, to transfer the
      northern tropic to the Arctic circle, would carry the existence of these supposed
      elephants 250,000 years back; a period far beyond our conception of the duration of
      animal bones left exposed to the open air, as these are in many instances. Besides,
      though these regions would then be supposed within the tropics, yet their winters
      would have been too severe for the sensibility of the elephant. They would have had
      too but one day and one night in the year, a circumstance to which we have no reason
      to suppose the nature of the elephant fitted. However, it has been demonstrated, that,
      if a variation of obliquity in the ecliptic takes place as all, it is vibratory, and
      never exceeds the limits of 9 degrees, which is not sufficient to bring these bones
      within the tropics. One of these hypotheses, or some other equally voluntary and inadmissible
      to cautious philosophy, must be adopted to 
<span id="page-70" class="pagenum">[ 70 ]</span> support the opinion that these are the bones of the elephant. For my own part, I
      find it easier to believe that an animal may have existed, resembling the elephant
      in his tusks, and general anatomy, while his nature was in other respects extremely
      different. From the 30th degree of South latitude to the 30th of North, are nearly
      the limits which nature has fixed for the existence and multiplication of the elephant
      known to us. Proceeding thence northwardly to 36½ degrees, we enter those assigned
      to the mammoth. The further we advance North, the more their vestiges multiply as
      far as the earth has been explored in that direction; and it is as probable as otherwise,
      that this progression continues to the pole itself, if land extends so far. The center
      of the Frozen zone then may be the Achmé of their vigour, as that of the Torrid is
      of the elephant. Thus nature seems to have drawn a belt of separation between these
      two tremendous animals, whose breadth indeed is not precisely known, though at present
      we may suppose it about 6½ degrees of latitude; to have assigned to the elephant the
      regions South of these confines, and those North to the mammoth, founding the constitution
      of the one in her extreme of heat, and that of the other in the extreme of cold. When
the Creator has therefore separated <span id="page-71" class="pagenum">[ 71 ]</span>
 their nature as far as the extent of the scale of animal life allowed to this planet
      would permit, it seems perverse to declare it the same, from a partial resemblance
      of their tusks and bones. But to whatever animal we ascribe these remains, it is certain
      such a one has existed in America, and that it has been the largest of all terrestrial
      beings. It should have sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited, and the atmosphere
      it breathed, from the imputation of impotence in the conception and nourishment of
      animal life on a large scale: to have stifled, in its birth, the opinion of a writer,
      the most learned too of all others in the science of animal history, that in the new
      world, 'La nature vivante est beaucoup moins agissante, beaucoup moins forte <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d634c40" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d634c40" class="addEditorial">"Living nature is much less active, much less strong."</span>:' that nature is less active, less energetic on one side of the globe than she is
      on the other. As if both sides were not warmed by the same genial sun; as if a soil
      of the same chemical composition, was less capable of elaboration into animal nutriment;
      as if the fruits and grains from that soil and sun, yielded a less rich chyle, gave
      less extension to the solids and fluids of the body, or produced sooner in the cartilages,
      membranes, and fibres, that rigidity which restrains all further extension, and terminates
animal growth. The truth is, that a Pigmy 
<span id="page-72" class="pagenum">[ 72 ]</span>
 and a Patagonian, a Mouse and a Mammoth, derive their dimensions from the same nutritive
      juices. The difference of increment depends on circumstances unsearchable to beings
      with our capacities. Every race of animals seems to have received from their Maker
      certain laws of extension at the time of their formation. Their elaborative organs
      were formed to produce this, while proper obstacles were opposed to its further progress.
      Below these limits they cannot fall, nor rise above them. What intermediate station
      they shall take may depend on soil, on climate, on food, on a careful choice of breeders.
      But all the manna of heaven would never raise the Mouse to the bulk of the Mammoth.

   <p id="xw20aab3d638">The opinion advanced by the Count de Buffon, is 1. That the animals common both to
      the old and new world, are smaller in the latter. 2. That those peculiar to the new,
      are on a smaller scale. 3. That those which have been domesticated in both, have degenerated
      in America: and 4. That on the whole it exhibits fewer species. And the reason he
      thinks is, that the heats of America are less; that more waters are spread over its
      surface by nature, and fewer of these drained off by the hand of man. In other words,
      that <i id="xw20aab3d638b1">heat</i> is friendly, and <i id="xw20aab3d638b3">moisture</i> 
<span id="page-73" class="pagenum">[ 73 ]</span>
 adverse to the production and developement of large quadrupeds. I will not meet this
      hypothesis on its first doubtful ground, whether the climate of America be comparatively
      more humid? Because we are not furnished with observations sufficient to decide this
      question. And though, till it be decided, we are as free to deny, as others are to
      affirm the fact, yet for a moment let it be supposed. The hypothesis, after this supposition,
      proceeds to another; that <i id="xw20aab3d638c11">moisture</i> is unfriendly to animal growth. The truth of this is inscrutable to us by reasonings
      a priori. Nature has hidden from us her modus agendi. Our only appeal on such questions
      is to experience; and I think that experience is against the supposition. It is by
      the assistance of <i id="xw20aab3d638c13">heat</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d638c15">moisture</i> that vegetables are elaborated from the elements of earth, air, water, and fire.
      We accordingly see the more humid climates produce the greater quantity of vegetables.
      Vegetables are mediately or immediately the food of every animal: and in proportion
      to the quantity of food, we see animals not only multiplied in their numbers, but
      improved in their bulk, as far as the laws of their nature will admit. Of this opinion
      is the Count de Buffon himself in another part of his work 'en general il paroit que

         of Podalia, of the Ukraine and of Tartary where the Kalmyks live are the largest of
         all."</span> Here then a race of animals, and one of the largest too, has been increased in its

      diminish animal bulk, and that it is their contraries <i id="xw20aab3d638c34">heat</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d638c36">dryness</i> which enlarge it. But when we appeal to experience, we are not to rest satisfied
      with a single fact. Let us therefore try our question on more general ground. Let
      us take two portions of the earth, Europe and America for instance, sufficiently extensive
      to give operation to general causes; let us consider the circumstances peculiar to
      each, and observe their effect on animal nature. America, running through the torrid
      as well as temperate zone, has more <i id="xw20aab3d638c38">heat</i>, collectively taken, than Europe. But Europe, according to our hypothesis, is the
      <i id="xw20aab3d638c40">dryest</i>. They are equally adapted then to animal productions; each being endowed with one
      of those causes which befriend animal growth, and with one which opposes it. If it
      be thought unequal to compare Europe 
<span id="page-75" class="pagenum">[ 75 ]</span> with America, which is so much larger, I answer, not more so than to compare America
      with the whole world. Besides, the purpose of the comparison is to try an hypothesis,
      which makes the size of animals depend on the <i id="xw20aab3d638c44">heat</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d638c46">moisture</i> of climate. If therefore we take a region, so extensive as to comprehend a sensible
      distinction of climate, and so extensive too as that local accidents, or the intercourse
      of animals on its borders, may not materially affect the size of those in its interior
      parts, we shall comply with those conditions which the hypothesis may reasonably demand.
      The objection would be the weaker in the present case, because any intercourse of
      animals which may take place on the confines of Europe and Asia, is to the advantage
      of the former, Asia producing certainly larger animals than Europe. Let us then take
      a comparative view of the Quadrupeds of Europe and America, presenting them to the
      eye in three different tables, in one of which shall be enumerated those found in
      both countries; in a second those found in one only; in a third those which have been
      domesticated in both. To facilitate the comparison, let those of each table be arranged
      in gradation according to their sizes, from the greatest to the smallest, so far as
      their sizes can be conjectured. The <span id="page-76" class="pagenum">[ 76 ]</span> weights of the large animals shall be expressed in the English avoirdupoise pound
      and its decimals: those of the smaller in the ounce and its decimals. Those which
      are marked thus *, are actual weights of particular subjects, deemed among the largest

      with the species, and saying, from conjecture only, what the largest individual they
      had seen would probably have weighed. The other weights are taken from Messrs. Buffon
      and D'Aubenton, and are of such subjects as came casually to their hands for dissection.
      This circumstance must be remembered where their weights and mine stand opposed: the
      latter being stated, not to produce a conclusion in favour of the American species,
      but to justify a suspension of opinion until we are better informed, and a suspicion
      in the mean time that there is no uniform difference in favour of either; which is
      all I pretend.

      has been given me by many who have seen them. <!--<div id="xw20aab3d682c28" class="marginNote">XXIV. 162.</div>--> But Mons. D'Aubenton says that the Renne of Europe is but about the size of a Red-deer.
      The wesel is larger in America than in Europe, as may be seen by comparing its dimensions
      as reported by Mons. D'Aubenton I. 35g. and Kalm. <!--<div id="xw20aab3d682c30" class="marginNote">XV. 42.</div><div id="xw20aab3d682c31" class="marginNote">I. 359. <br id="xw20aab3d682c31b1"></br>I. 48. 221. <br id="xw20aab3d682c31b3"></br> 251.

      <i id="xw20aab3d682c33">same</i> in America as in Europe: by which expression I understand, they are the same in all
      material circumstances, in size as well as others: for if they were smaller, they
      would differ from the European. Our grey fox is, by Catesby's account, <!--<div id="xw20aab3d682c35" class="marginNote">II. 78. </div>--> little different in size and shape from the European fox. I presume he means the
red fox of Europe, 
<span id="page-83" class="pagenum">[ 83 ]</span>
 as does Kalm, where he says, that in size <div id="xw20aab3d682c42" class="marginNote">I. 220.</div> 'they do not quite come up to our foxes.' For proceeding next to the red fox of America,
      he says 'they are entirely the same with the European sort.' Which shews he had in
      view one European sort only, which was the red. So that the result of their testimony
      is, that the American grey fox is somewhat less than the European red; which is equally
      true of the grey fox of Europe, as may be seen by comparing the measures of the Count
      de Buffon and Mons. D'Aubenton. <div id="xw20aab3d682c44" class="marginNote">XXVII. <br id="xw20aab3d682c44b1"></br> 63. XIV. <br id="xw20aab3d682c44b3"></br> 119. Harris, II. 387. <br id="xw20aab3d682c44b5"></br> Buffon. <br id="xw20aab3d682c44b7"></br> Quad. IX. 1.</div> The white bear of America is as large as that of Europe. The bones of the Mammoth
      which have been found in America, are as large as those found in the old world. It
      may be asked, why I insert the Mammoth, as if it still existed? I ask in return, why
      I should omit it, as if it did not exist? Such is the oeconomy of nature, that no
      instance can be produced of her having permitted any one race of her animals to become
      extinct; of her having formed any link in her great work so weak as to be broken.
      To add to this, the traditionary testimony of the Indians, that this animal still
      exists in the northern and western parts of America, would be adding the light of
      a taper to that of the meridian sun. Those parts still remain in their aboriginal
state, unexplored and <span id="page-84" class="pagenum">[ 84 ]</span>
 undisturbed by us, or by others for us, He may as well exist there now, as he did
      formerly where we find his bones. If he be a carnivorous animal, as some Anatomists
      have conjectured, and the Indians affirm, his early retirement may be accounted for
      from the general destruction of the wild game by the Indians, which commences in the
      first instant of their connection with us, for the purpose of purchasing matchcoats,
      hatchets, and fire locks, with their skins. There remain then the buffalo, red deer,
      fallow deer, wolf, roe, glutton <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d682c51" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d682c51" class="addEditorial">Wolverine.</span>, wild cat, monax <span id="xw20aab3d682c53" class="addEditorial">Ground-hog.</span>, vison, hedge-hog, martin, and water rat, of the comparative sizes of which we have
      not sufficient testimony. It does not appear that Messrs. de Buffon and D'Aubenton
      have measured, weighed, or seen those of America. It is said of some of them, by some
      travellers, that they are smaller than the European. But who were these travellers?
      Have they not been men of a very different description from those who have laid open
      to us the other three quarters of the world? Was natural history the object of their
      travels? Did they measure or weigh the animals they speak of? or did they not judge
      of them by sight, or perhaps even from report only? Were they are acquainted with
the animals of their own country, with which they undertake to 
<span id="page-85" class="pagenum">[ 85 ]</span>
 compare them? Have they not been so ignorant as often to mistake the species? A true
      answer to these questions would probably lighten their authority, so as to render
      it insufficient for the foundation of an hypothesis. How unripe we yet are, for an
      accurate comparison of the animals of the two countries, will appear from the work
      of Mons. de Buffon. The ideas we should have formed of the sizes of some animals,
      from the information he had received at his first publications concerning them, are
      very different from what his subsequent communications give us. And indeed his candour
      in this can never be too much praised. One sentence of his book must do him immortal
      honour. <div id="xw20aab3d682c60" class="marginNote">Quad. IX. <br id="xw20aab3d682c60b1"></br> 158.</div>'J'aime autant une personne qui me releve d'une erreur, qu'une autre qui m'apprend

         me of a truth, because in effect an error corrected is a truth."</span> He seems to have thought the Cabiai he first examined wanted little of its full growth.
      <div id="xw20aab3d682c64" class="marginNote">XXV. 184.</div> 'II n'etoit pas encore tout-a-fait adulte.' <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d682c66" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d682c66" class="addEditorial">"It was not yet fully an adult."</span> Yet he weighed but 46½ lb. <div id="xw20aab3d682c68" class="marginNote">Quad. IX. 132.</div> and he found afterwards, that these animals, when full grown, weigh 100 lb. <div id="xw20aab3d682c70" class="marginNote">XIX. 2.</div> He had supposed, from the examination of a jaguar, said to be two years old, which
      weighed but 16 lb. 12 oz. that, when he should have acquired his full growth, he would
      not be larger than a middle sized dog. <span id="page-86" class="pagenum">[ 86 ]</span>
      <div id="xw20aab3d682c77" class="marginNote">Quad. IX. 41.</div>
      But a subsequent account raises his weight to 200 lb. Further information will, doubtless,
      produce further corrections. The wonder is, not that there is yet something in this
      great work to correct, but that there is so little. The result of this view then is,
      that of 26 quadrupeds common to both countries, 7 are said to be larger in America,
      7 of equal size, and 12, not sufficiently examined. So that the first table impeaches
      the first member of the assertion, that of the animals common to both countries, the
      American are smallest, 'et cela sans aucune exception.' It shews it not just, in all
      the latitude in which its author has advanced it, and probably not to such a degree
      as to found a distinction between the two countries.

   <p id="xw20aab3d684">Proceeding to the second table, which arranges the animals found in one of the two
      countries only, Mons. de Buffon observes, that the tapir, the elephant of America,
      is but of the size of a small cow. To preserve our comparison, I will add that the
      wild boar, the elephant of Europe, is little more than half that size. I have made
      an elk with round or cylindrical horns, an animal of America, and peculiar to it because
      I have seen many of them myself, and more of their horns; and because I can say, from
      the best information, that, in Virgina, this kind of elk has abounded much, and still
<span id="page-87" class="pagenum">[ 87 ]</span>
 exists in smaller numbers; and I could never learn that the palmated kind had been
      seen here at all. I suppose this confined to the more Northern latitudes *. I have
      made our

         the flat-horned elk is found in the northern parts of America. It has not however
         extended to our latitudes. On the other hand, I could never learn that the round-horned
         elk has been seen further North than the Hudson's river. This agrees with the former
         elk in its general character, being, like that, when compared with a deer, very much
         larger, its ears longer, broader, and thicker in proportion, its hair much longer,
         neck and tail shorter, having a dewlap before the breast (caruncula gutturalis Linnaei)
         a white spot often, if not always, of a foot diameter, on the hinder part of the buttocks
         round the tail; its gait a trot, and attended with a rattling of the hoofs: but distinguished
         from that decisively by its horns, which are not palmated, but round and pointed.
         This is the animal described by Catesby as the Cervus major Americanus, the Stag of
         America, le Cerf de l'Amerique. But it differs from the Cervus as totally, as does
         the palmated elk from the dama. And in fact it seems to stand in the same relation
         to the palmated elk, as the red deer does to the fallow. It has abounded in Virginia,
         has been seen, within my knowledge, on the Eastern side of the Blue ridge since the
         year 1765, is now common beyond those mountains, has been often brought to us and
         tamed, and their horns are in the hands of many. I should designate it as the 'Alces

      hare or rabbet peculiar, believing it to b different from both the European animals or those denominations, and calling it therefore,
      by its Algonquin name Whabus, to keep it distinct from these. <div id="xw20aab3d684c16" class="marginNote">Kalm II. <br id="xw20aab3d684c16b1"></br> 340. I. 82.</div> Kalm is of the same opinion. I have enumerated the squirrels 
      <span id="xw20aab3d684c18" class="authorNote">teretibus. It were to be wished, that Naturalists, who are acquainted with the renne
         and elk of Europe, and who may hereafter visit the northern parts of America, would
         examine well the animals called there by the names of grey and black moose, caribou,
         orignal, and elk. Mons. de Buffon has done what could be done from the materials in
         his hands, towards clearing up the confusion introduced by the loose application of
         these names among the animals they are meant to designate. He reduces the whole to
         the renne and flathorned elk. From all the information I have been able to collect,
         I strongly suspect they will be found to cover three, if not four distinct species
         of animals. I have seen skins of a moose, and of the caribou: they differ more from
         each other, and from that of the roundhorned elk, than I ever saw two skins differ
         which belonged to different individuals of any wild species. These differences are
         in the colour, length, and coarseness of the hair, and in the size, texture, and marks
         of the skin. Perhaps it will be found that there is, 1. the moose, black and grey,
         the former being said to be the male, and the latter the female, 2. The caribou or
         renne. 3. The flat-horned elk, or orignal. 4. The round-horned elk. Should this last,
         though possessing so nearly the characters of the elk, be found to be the same with
         the Cerf d'Ardennes or Brandhirtz of Germany, still there will remain the three species
         first enumerated.</span>
      <span id="page-89" class="pagenum">[ 89 ]</span> according to our own knowledge, derived from daily sight of them, because I am not
      able to reconcile with that the European appellations and descriptions. I have heard
      of other species, but they have never come within my own notice. These, I think, are
      the only instances in which I have departed from the authority of Mons. de Buffon
      in the construction of this table. I take him for my ground work, because I think
      him the best informed of any Naturalist who has ever written. The result is, that
      there are 18 quadrupeds peculiar to Europe; more than four times as many, to wit 74,
      peculiar to America; that the * 
      first of these 74 weighs more than the whole column of Europeans; and consequently
      this second table disproves the second member of the assertion, that the 
      <span id="xw20aab3d684c22" class="authorNote">* The Tapir is the largest of the animals peculiar to America. I collect his weight
         thus. Mons. de Buffon says, XXIII. 274. that he is of the size of a Zebu, or a small
         cow. He gives us the measures of of a Zebu, ib. 94. as taken by himself, viz. 5 feet 7 inches from the muzzle to the
         root of the tail, and 5 feet 1 inch circumference behind the fore legs. A bull, measuring
         in the same way 6 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 2 inches, weighed 600 lb. VIII. 153. The
         Zebu then, and of course the Tapir, would weigh about 500 lb. But one individual of
         every species of European peculiars would probably weigh less than 400 lb. These are
         French measures and weights.</span> 
      <span id="page-90" class="pagenum">[ 90 ]</span> animals peculiar to the new world are on a smaller scale, so far as that assertion
      relied on European animals for support: and it is in full opposition to the theory
      which makes the animal volume to depend on the circumstances of <i id="xw20aab3d684c26">heat</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d684c28">moisture</i>.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d686">The IIId. table comprehends those quadrupeds only which are domestic in both countries.
      That some of these, in some parts of America, have become less than their original
      stock, is doubtless true; and the reason is very obvious. In a thinly peopled country,
      the spontaneous productions of the forests and waste fields are sufficient to support
      indifferently the domestic animals of the farmer, with a very little aid from him
      in the severest and scarcest season. He therefore finds it more convenient to receive
      them from the hand of nature in that indifferent state, than to keep up their size
      by a care and nourishment which would cost him much labour. If, on this low fare,
      these animals dwindle, it is no more than they do in those parts of Europe where the
      poverty of the soil, or poverty of the owner, reduces them to the same scanty subsistance.
      It is the uniform effect of one and the same cause, whether acting on this or that
      side of the globe. It would be erring therefore against that rule of philosophy, which
      teaches us to ascribe 
<span id="page-91" class="pagenum">[ 91 ]</span>
      like effects to like causes, should we impute this diminution of size in America to
      any imbecility or want of uniformity in the operations of nature. It may be affirmed
      with truth that, in those countries, and with those individuals of America, where
      necessity or curiosity has produced equal attention as in Europe to the nourishment
      of animals, the horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs of the one continent are as large
      as those of the other. There are particular instances, well attested, where individuals
      of this country have imported good breeders from England, and have improved their
      size by care in the course of some years. To make a fair comparison between the two
      countries, it will not answer to bring together animals of what might be deemed the
      middle or ordinary size of their species; because an error in judging of that middle
      or ordinary size would vary the result of the comparison. <div id="xw20aab3d686b6" class="marginNote">VII. 432.</div> Thus Monsieur D'Aubenton considers a horse of 4 feet 5 inches high and 400 lb. weight
      French, equal to 4 feet 8.6 inches and 436 lb. English, as a middle sized horse. Such
      a one is deemed a small horse in America. The extremes must therefore be resorted
      to. The same anatomist dissected a horse of 5 feet 9 inches height <div id="xw20aab3d686b8" class="marginNote">VII. 474.</div> French measure, equal to 6 feet 1.7 English. This is near 6 inches higher than any
      horse 
<span id="page-92" class="pagenum">[ 92 ]</span>
 I have seen: and could it be supposed that I had seen the largest horses in America,
      the conclusion would be, that ours have diminished, or that we have bred from a smaller
      stock. In Connecticut and Rhode-Island, where the climate is favorable to the production
      of grass, bullocks have been slaughtered which weighed 2500, 2200, and 2100 lb. nett;
      and those of 1800 lb. have been frequent. I have seen a * hog weigh 1050 1b. after
      the blood, bowels, and hair had been taken from him. Before he was killed an attempt
      was made to weigh him with a pair of steel-yards, graduated to 1200 lb. but he weighed
      more. Yet this hog was probably not within fifty generations of the European stock.
      I am well informed of another which weighed 1100 lb. gross. Asses have been still
      more neglected than any other domestic animal in America. They are neither fed nor
      housed in the most rigorous season of the year. <div id="xw20aab3d686c15" class="marginNote">VIII. 48. 55. 66.</div> Yet they are larger than those measured by Mons. D'Aubenton, of 3 feet 7¼ inches,
      3 feet 4 inches, and 3 feet 2½ inches, the latter weighing only 215.81b. These sizes,
      I suppose, have been produced by the same negligence in Europe, which has produced
      a like diminution here. Where care has been taken of them on that side of the 
      <span id="xw20aab3d686c17" class="authorNote">* In Williamsburg, April, 1769.</span>
<span id="page-93" class="pagenum">[ 93 ]</span>
      water, they have been raised to a size bordering on that of the horse; not by the
      <i id="xw20aab3d686c24">heat</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d686c26">dryness</i> of the climate, but by good food and shelter. Goats have been also much neglected
      in America. Yet they are very prolific here, bearing twice or three times a year,
      and from one to five kids at a birth. <div id="xw20aab3d686c28" class="marginNote">XVIII. 96.</div> Mons. de Buffon has been sensible of a difference in this circumstance in favour
      of America. But what are their greatest weights I cannot say. A large sheep here weighs
      100 lb. <div id="xw20aab3d686c30" class="marginNote">IX. 41.</div> I observe Mons. D'Aubenton calls a ram of 62 lb. one of the middle size. But to say
      what are the extremes of growth in these and the other domestic animals of America,
      would require information of which no one individual is possessed. The weights actually
      known and stated in the third table preceding will suffice to shew, that we may conclude,
      on probable grounds, that, with equal food and care, the climate of America will preserve
      the races of domestic animals as large as the European stock from which they are derived;
      and consequently that the third member of Mons. de Buffon's assertion, that the domestic
      animals are subject to degeneration from the climate of America, is as probably wrong
      as the first and second were certainly so.
   </p>
   <p><span id="page-94" class="pagenum">[ 94 ]</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d694">That the last part of it is erroneous, which affirms that the species of American
      quadrupeds are comparatively few, is evident from the tables taken all together. By
      these it appears that there are an hundred species aboriginal of America. <div id="xw20aab3d694b1" class="marginNote">XXX. 219.</div> Mons. de Buffon supposes about double that number existing on the whole earth. Of
      these Europe, Asia, and Africa, furnish suppose 126; that is, the 26 common to Europe
      and America, and about 100 which are not in America at all. The American species then
      are to those of the rest of the earth, as 106 to 126, or 4 to 5. But the residue of
      the earth being double the extent of America, the exact proportion would have been
      but as 4 to 8.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d696">Hitherto I have considered this hypothesis as applied to brute animals only, and not
      in its extension to the man of America, whether aboriginal or transplanted. It is
      the opinion of Mons. de Buffon that the former furnishes no exception to it. <div id="xw20aab3d696b1" class="marginNote">XVIII.146</div>  'Quoique le sauvage du nouveau monde soit à-peu-près de même stature que l'homme

         our world, that is not enough for him to be an exception to the general fact of the
         diminishment of living nature in the entirety of that continent.  The savage is weak
         and small in the organs of generation; he has neither hair nor beard nor ardor for
         his female; although he is faster than the European because he is more accustomed
         to running, he is nonetheless less strong of body; he is also less sensitive and as
         a result more fearful and more cowardly; he has less vivacity, less activity of his
         spirit; that of his body is less an exercise, a voluntary movement than a necessary
         action caused by need; take from him his hunger and his thirst and you will destroy
         at the same time the active principle of all his movements; he will stupidly rest
         on his legs or lie down for whole days.  There is no need to search very far for the
         cause of the dispersed life of the savages or their estrangement from society:  that
         most precious spark of nature has been refused them; they lack ardor for their females,
         and as a result for their fellows: they know nothing of the most powerful attachment,
         the most tender of all, the other emotions of that kind have become cold and languishing;
         they only love their parents and their children; the most intimate society of all,
         that of their own family, has only the most feeble ties; the society of one family
         to another has no tie at all:  their is no reunion, no republic, no social state.
         Among them, physical love is their morality; their heart is icy, their society cold,
         and their empire harsh.  They only regard their wives as they do servants or beasts
         whom they load, without thought, from their hunt, and whom they force without mercy,
         without gratitude, to work that is often beyond their strength:  they have but a few
         children; they take little care of them; they feel the full pain of their first flaw;
         they are indifferent because they have little sexual power, and their indifference
         for the female sex is the original stain that condemns their nature, which impedes
         their development, and which, destroying the seeds of life, strikes at the same time
         at the roots of society. Man is no exception here. Refusing the power of love, nature
         has treated him more badly and belittled him more than any of the animals."</span> An afflicting picture indeed, which, for the honor of human nature, I am glad to
      believe has no original. Of the Indian of South America I know nothing; for I would
      not honor with the appellation of knowledge, what I derive from the fables published
      of them. These I believe to be just as true as the fables of Aesop. This belief is
      founded on what I have seen of man, white, red, and black, and what has been written
      of him by authors, enlightened themselves, and writing amidst an enlightened people.
      The Indian of North America being more within our reach, I can speak of him somewhat
      from

 my own knowledge but more from the information of others better acquainted with him,
      and on whose truth and judgment I can rely. From these sources I am able to say, in
      contradiction to this representation, that he is neither more defective in ardor,
      nor more impotent with his female, than the white reduced to the same diet and exercise:
      that he is brave, when an enterprize depends on bravery; education with him making
      the point of honor consist in the destruction of an enemy by stratagem, and in the
      preservation of his own person free from injury; or perhaps this is nature; while
      it is education which teaches us to * honor force more than finesse: that he will

         Ulloa here admits, that the authors who have described the Indians of South America,
         before they were enslaved, had represented them as a brave people, and therefore seems
         to have suspected that the cowardice which he had observed in those of the present
         race might he the effect of subjugation. But, supposing the Indians of North America
         to be cowards also, he concludes the ancestors of those of South America to have been
         so too, and therefore that those authors have given fictions for truths. He was probably
         not acquainted himself with the Indians of North America, and had formed his opinion
         of them from hear-say. Great numbers of French, of English, and of Americans, are
         perfectly acquainted with these people. Had he had an opportunity of enquiring of
         any of these, they would have told him, that there never was an instance known of
         an Indian begging his life when in the power of his enemies: on the contrary, that
         he courts death by every possible insult and provocation. His reasoning then would
         have been reversed thus. 'Since the present Indian of North America is brave, and
         authors tell us, that the ancestors of those of South America were brave also; it
         must follow, that the cowardice of their descendants is the effect of subjugation

            in the Virginia House of Burgesses and later fought in the French and Indian War.</span>, who was sent to the Cherokee nation to transact some business with them. It happened
         that some of our disorderly people had just killed one or two of that nation. It was
         therefore proposed in the council of the Cherokees that Col. Byrd should be put to
         death, in revenge for the loss of their countrymen. Among them was a chief called
         Silòuee, who, on some former occasion, had contracted an acquaintance and friendship
         with Col. Byrd. He came to him every night in his tent, and told him not to be afraid,
         they should not kill him. After many days deliberation, however, the determination
         was, contrary to Silòuee's expectation, that Byrd should be put to death, and some
         warriors were dispatched as executioners. Silòuee attended them, and when they entered
         the tent, he threw himself between them and Byrd, and said to the warriors, 'this
         man is my friend: before you get at him, you must kill me.' On which they returned,
         and the council respected the principle so much as to recede from their determination.</span>  
      <span id="page-100" class="pagenum">[ 100 ]</span> on the loss of their children, though in general they endeavour to appear superior
      to human events: that his vivacity and activity of mind is equal to ours in the same
      situation; hence his eagerness for hunting, and for games of chance. The women are
      submitted to unjust drudgery. This I believe is the case with every barbarous people.
      With such, force is law. The stronger sex therefore imposes on the weaker. It is civilization
      alone which replaces women in the enjoyment of their natural equality. That first
      teaches us to subdue the selfish passions, and to respect those rights in others which
      we value in ourselves. Were we in equal barbarism, our females would be equal drudges.
      The man with them is less strong than with us, but their woman stronger than ours;
      and both for the same obvious reason; because our man and their woman is habituated
      to labour, and formed by it. With both races the sex which is indulged with ease is
      least athletic. An Indian man is small in the hand and wrist for the same reason for
      which a sailor is large and strong in the arms and shoulders, and a porter in the
      legs and thighs.&#8212; They raise fewer children than we do. The causes of this are to
      be found, not in a difference of nature, but of circumstance. The women very frequently
      attending the men in 
<span id="page-101" class="pagenum">[ 101 ]</span>
 their parties of war and of hunting, childbearing becomes extremely inconvenient
      to them. It is said, therefore, that they have learnt the practice of procuring abortion
      by the use of some vegetable; and that it even extends to prevent conception for a
      considerable time after. During these parties they are exposed to numerous hazards,
      to excessive exertions, to the greatest extremities of hunger. Even at their homes
      the nation depends for food, through a certain part of every year, on the gleanings
      of the forest: that is, they experience a famine once in every year. With all animals,
      if the female be badly fed, or not fed at all, her young perish: and if both male
      and female be reduced to like want, generation becomes less active, less productive.
      To the obstacles then of want and hazard, which nature has opposed to the multiplication
      of wild animals, for the purpose of restraining their numbers within certain bounds,
      those of labour and of voluntary abortion are added with the Indian. No wonder then
      if they multiply less than we do. Where food is regularly supplied, a single farm
      will shew more of cattle, than a whole country of forests can of buffaloes. The same
      Indian women, when married to white traders, who feed them and their children plentifully
      and regularly, who exempt 
<span id="page-102" class="pagenum">[ 102 ]</span>
 them from excessive drudgery, who keep them stationary and unexposed to accident,
      produce and raise as many children as the white women. Instances are known, under
      these circumstances, of their rearing a dozen children. An inhuman practice once prevailed
      in this country of making slaves of the Indians. It is a fact well known with us,
      that the Indian women so enslaved produced and raised as numerous families as either
      the whites or blacks among whom they lived.&#8212; It has been said, that Indians have less
      hair than the whites, except on the head. But this is a fact of which fair proof can
      scarcely be had. With them it is disgraceful to be hairy on the body. They say it
      likens them to hogs. They therefore pluck the hair as fast as it appears. But the
      traders who marry their women, and prevail on them to discontinue this practice, say,
      that nature is the same with them as with the whites. Nor, if the fact be true, is
      the consequence necessary which has been drawn from it. Negroes have notoriously less
      hair than the whites; yet they are more ardent. But if cold and moisture be the agents
      of nature for diminishing the races of animals, how comes she all at once to suspend
      their operation as to the physical man of the new world, whom the Count acknowledges
      to be 'à peu près 
<span id="page-103" class="pagenum">[ 103 ]</span>
    de mème stature que l'homme de notre monde,' <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d696c46" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d696c46" class="addEditorial">French: "almost the same stature as men of our world."</span> and to let loose their influence on his moral faculties? <div id="xw20aab3d696c48" class="marginNote">XVIII. 145.</div> How has this 'combination of the elements and other physical causes, so contrary
      to the enlargement of animal nature in this new world, these obstacles to the developement
      and formation of great germs,' been arrested and suspended, so as to permit the human
      body to acquire its just dimensions, and by what inconceivable process has their action
      been directed on his mind alone? To judge of the truth of this, to form a just estimate
      of their genius and mental powers, more facts are wanting, and great allowance to
      be made for those circumstances of their situation which call for a display of particular
      talents only. This done, we shall probably find that they are formed in mind as well
      as in body, on the same module with the * 'Homo sapiens Europæus.' The principles
      of their society forbidding all compulsion, they are to be led to duty and to enterprize
      by personal influence and persuasion. Hence eloquence in council, bravery and address
      in war, become the foundations of all consequence with them. To these acquirements
      all their faculties are directed. Of their bravery and address in war we have multiplied
      proofs, because we have been the 
      <span id="xw20aab3d696c50" class="authorNote"> * Linn. Syst. Definition of a Man.</span>
      <span id="page-104" class="pagenum">[ 104 ]</span> subjects on which they were exercised. Of their eminence in oratory we have fewer
      examples, because it is displayed chiefly in their own councils. Some, however, we
      have of very superior lustre. I may challenge the whole orations of Demosthenes and
      Cicero, and of any more eminent orator, if Europe has furnished more eminent, to produce
      a single passage, superior to the speech of Logan, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d696c54" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d696c54" class="addEditorial">Logan (c. 1723-1809), a Native American orator and warrior. Originally a member of the Cayuga
         nation, he moved to the Ohio territory in the 1760s, at which point he started being
         referred to as a Mingo, as Jefferson calls him here.</span> a Mingo chief, to Lord Dunmore, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d696c56" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d696c56" class="addEditorial">Lord Dunmore (1730-1809) was the colonial governor of Virginia in April, 1774, when
         white settlers from Virginia attacked and massacred many Mingos, including members
         of Logan's family, in retaliation for Indian attacks that had provoked by settlers'
         encroachment on their territories.</span> when governor of this state. And, as a testimony of their talents in this line, I
      beg leave to introduce it, first stating the incidents necessary for understanding
      it. In the spring of the year 1774, a robbery and murder were committed on an inhabitant
      of the frontiers of Virginia, by two Indians of the Shawanee tribe. The neighbouring
      whites, according to their custom, undertook to punish this outrage in a summary way.
      Col. Cresap, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d696c58" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d696c58" class="addEditorial">Michael Cresap (1742-75) was actually not involved in this particular raid, although he had participated in similar events. See the note on page 106 about the consequences of Jefferson's claim, which he based on Logan's account of events, an account that was contested by Cresap's descendants.</span> a man infamous for the many murders he had committed on those much-injured people,
      collected a party, and proceeded down the Kanhaway in quest of vengeance. Unfortunately
      a canoe of women and children, with one man only, was seen coming from the opposite
      shore, unarmed, and unsuspecting an hostile attack from the whites. Cresap and his
      party concealed themselves on the bank of the river, and the moment the 
      <span id="page-105" class="pagenum">[ 105 ]</span> canoe reached the shore, singled out their objects, and, at one fire, killed every
      person in it. This happened to be the family of Logan, who had long been distinguished
      as a friend of the whites. This unworthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly
      signalized himself in the war which ensued. In the autumn of the same year, a decisive
      battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, between the collected forces
      of the Shawanees, Mingoes, and Delawares, and a detachment of the Virginia militia.
      The Indians were defeated, and sued for peace. Logan however disdained to be seen
      among the suppliants. But, lest the sincerity of a treaty should be distrusted, from
      which so distinguished a chief absented himself, he sent by a messenger the following
      speech to be delivered to Lord Dunmore.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d698">'I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he
      gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. During
      the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate
      for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed,
      and said, 'Logan is the friend of white men.' I had even thought to have lived with
you, but for the injuries of one <span id="page-106" class="pagenum">[ 106 ]</span>
 man. Col. Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the
      relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There runs not a drop
      of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I
      have sought it: I have killed many: I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country,
      I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy
      of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who
      is there to mourn for Logan? &#8212;Not one.'

   <p id="xw20aab3d700">Before we condemn the Indians of this continent as wanting genius, we must consider
      that letters have not yet been introduced among them. Were we to compare them in their
      present state with the Europeans North of the Alps, when the Roman arms and arts first
      crossed those mountains, the comparison would be unequal, because, at that time, those
      parts of Europe were swarming with numbers; because numbers produce emulation, and
      multiply the chances of improvement, and one improvement begets another. Yet I may
      safely ask, How many good poets, how many able mathematicians, how many great inventors
      in arts or sciences, had Europe North of the Alps then produced? And it was sixteen
centuries after this before <span id="page-107" class="pagenum">[ 107 ]</span>
      a Newton could be formed. I do not mean to deny, that there are varieties in the race
      of man, distinguished by their powers both of body and mind. I believe there are,
      as I see to be the case in the races of other animals. I only mean to suggest a doubt,
      whether the bulk and faculties of animals depend on the side of the Atlantic on which
      their food happens to grow, or which furnishes the elements of which they are compounded?
      Whether nature has enlisted herself as a Cis or Trans-Atlantic partisan? I am induced
      to suspect, there has been more eloquence than sound reasoning displayed in support
      of this theory; that it is one of those cases where the judgment has been seduced
      by a glowing pen: and whilst I render every tribute of honor and esteem to the celebrated
      Zoologist, who has added, and is still adding, so many precious things to the treasures
      of science, I must doubt whether in this instance he has not cherished error also,
      by lending her for a moment his vivid imagination and bewitching language. (4)

   <p id="xw20aab3d702">So far the Count de Buffon has carried this new theory of the tendency of nature to
      belittle her productions on this side the Atlantic. Its application to the race of
      whites, transplanted from Europe, remained for the Abbé Raynal. 'On doit etre etonné
      (he

         America has not yet produced a good poet, a talented mathematician, a man of genius
         in any art, or any science."</span> 7. Hist. Philos. p. 92. ed. Mæstricht. 1774. 'America has not yet produced one good
      poet.' When we shall have existed as a people as long as the Greeks did before they
      produced a Homer, the Romans a Virgil, the French a Racine and Voltaire, the English
      a Shakespeare and Milton, should this reproach be still true, we will enquire from
      what unfriendly causes it has proceeded, that the other countries of Europe and quarters
      of the earth shall not have inscribed any name in the roll of poets *. But neither
      has America produced 'one able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or
      a single science.' In war we have produced a Washington, whose memory will be adored
      while liberty shall have votaries, whose name will triumph over time, and will in
      future ages assume its just station among the most celebrated worthies of the world,
      <span id="xw20aab3d702b8" class="authorNote">* Has the world as yet produced more than two poets, acknowledged to be such by all
         nations? An Englishman, only, rends Milton with delight, an Italian Tasso, a Frenchman
         the Henriade, a Portuguese Camouens: but Homer and Virgil have been the rapture of
         every age and nation: they are read with enthusiasm in their originals by those who
         can read the originals, and in translations by those who cannot.</span>

      when that wretched philosophy shall be forgotten which would have arranged him among
      the degeneracies of nature. In physics we have produced a Franklin, than whom no one
      of the present age has made more important discoveries, nor has enriched philosophy
      with more, or more ingenious solutions of the phænomena of nature. We have supposed
      Mr. Rittenhouse <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d702c15" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d702c15" class="addEditorial">David Rittenhouse (1732-1796), American astronomer, and one of the period's most famous
         American men of science. The "mechanical genius" to which Jefferson refers derives
         from Rittenhouse's construction of an "Orrery" (so called after the Earl of Orrery,
         the patron of the Englishman George Graham, who had built one as early as 1704), a
         mechanical model of the planets in orbit around the sun. Rittenhouse's models were
         more sophisticated than the original. In the footnote to this page, Jefferson chafes
         at using the name "Orrery" to describe Rittenhouse's American-built instrument, as
         he complains about the general use of the name "Hadley's quadrant" to describe the
         navigational instrument built by the American Thomas Godfrey at about the same time
         as that constructed by the Englishman John Hadley.</span> second to no astronomer living: that in genius he must be the first, because he is
      self-taught. As an artist he has exhibited as great a proof of mechanical genius as
      the world has ever produced. He has not indeed made a world; but he has by imitation
      approached nearer its Maker than any man who has lived from the creation to this day*
      As in philosophy and war, so in government, in oratory, in painting, in the plastic
      art, we might shew that America, though but a child of yesterday, has already given
      hopeful proofs of genius, as well of the nobler kinds, which arouse the best feelings
      of man, which call him into action, which substantiate his freedom, and conduct him
      to happiness, as of 
      <span id="xw20aab3d702c17" class="authorNote">* There are various ways of keeping truth out of sight. Mr. Rittenhouse's model of
         the planetary system has the plagiary appellation of an Orrery; and the quadrant invented
         by Godfrey, an American also, and with the aid of which the European nations traverse
         the globe, is called Hadley's quadrant.</span> 
      <span id="page-110" class="pagenum">[ 110 ]</span> the subordinate, which serve to amuse him only. We therefore suppose, that this reproach
      is as unjust as it is unkind; and that, of the geniuses which adorn the present age,
      America contributes its full share. For comparing it with those countries, where genius
      is most cultivated, where are the most excellent models for art, and scaffoldings
      for the attainment of science, as France and England for instance, we calculate thus.
      The United States contain three millions of inhabitants; France twenty millions; and
      the British islands ten. We produce a Washington, a Franklin, a Rittenhouse. France
      then should have half a dozen in each of these lines, and Great-Britain half that
      number, equally eminent. It may be true, that France has: we are but just becoming
      acquainted with her, and our acquaintance so far gives us high ideas of the genius
      of her inhabitants. It would be injuring too many of them to, name particularly a
      Voltaire, a Buffon, the constellation of Encyclopedists, the Abbé Raynal himself,
      &amp;c. &amp;c. We therefore have reason to believe she can produce her full quota of genius.
      The present war having so long cut off all communication with Great-Britain, we are
      not able to make a fair estimate of the state of science in that country. The spirit
      in which she wages war is the only 
<span id="page-111" class="pagenum">[ 111 ]</span>
      sample before our eyes, and that does not seem the legitimate offspring either of
      science or of civilization. The sun of her glory is fast descending to the horizon.
      Her philosophy has crossed the Channel, her freedom the Atlantic, and herself seems
      passing to that awful dissolution, whose issue is not given human foresight to scan

   <span id="xw20aab3d704" class="authorNote"> * In a later edition of the Abbé Raynal's work, he has withdrawn his censure from

      South. If he was mistaken then as to the former, he may be so as to the latter. The
      glimmerings which reach us from South America enable us only to see that its inhabitants
      are held under the accumulated pressure of slavery, superstition, and ignorance. Whenever
      they shall be able to rise under this weight, and to shew themselves to the rest of

      and Portugueze chiefly, and almost exclusively. These, going from a country of the
      old world remarkably dry in its soil and climate, fancied there were more lakes and
      fogs in South America than in Europe. An inhabitant of Ireland, Sweden, or Finland,

   <p id="xw20aab3d734">And doubtless many others which have not yet been described and classed.</p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d736">To this catalogue of our indigenous animals, I will add a short account of an anomaly
      of nature, taking place sometimes in the race of negroes brought from Africa, who,
      though black themselves, have in rare instances, white children, called Albinos. I
      have known four of these myself, and have faithful accounts of three others. The circumstances
      in which all the individuals agree are these. They are of a pallid cadaverous white,
      untinged with red, without any coloured spots or seams; their hair of the same kind
      of white, short, coarse, and curled as is 
      <span id="page-t-i_16_page_2" class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 16, Page 2 ]</span>
		<p>	the Bald-coot, or Coot is the Fulica of Linnaeus, &amp; the Foulque of the Encyclop.
            Meth. differing from the description of the latter only in the colour of it's feet
            &amp; legs, which are olive green, without any circle of red, &amp; that of the bill a faint
            carnation, brown at the point, &amp; the membrane on the forehead of a very dark purple.
            It is distinguished from the Gallinula chloropis, Poule d'eau, Water-hen, Hydro-gallina,
            chiefly by the festooned web bordering the toes.</p>
      <span id="page-119" class="pagenum">[ 119 ]</span> that of the negro; all of them well formed, strong, healthy, perfect in their senses,
      except that of sight, and born of parents who had no mixture of white blood. Three
      of these Albinos were sisters, having two other full sisters, who were black. The
      youngest of the three was killed by lightning, at twelve years of age. The eldest
      died at about 27 years of age, in child-bed, with her second child. The middle one
      is now alive in health, and has issue, as the eldest had, by a black man, which issue
      was black. They are uncommonly shrewd, quick in their apprehensions and in reply.
      Their eyes are in a perpetual tremulous vibration, very weak, and much affected by
      the sun: but they see better in the night than we do. They are of the property of
      Col. Skipwith, of Cumberland. The fourth is a negro woman, whose parents came from
      Guinea, and had three other children, who were of their own colour. She is freckled,
      her eye-sight so weak that she is obliged to wear a bonnet in the summer; but it is
      better in the night than day. She had an Albino child by a black man. It died at the
      age of a few weeks. These were the property of Col. Carter, of Albemarle. A sixth
      instance is a woman of the property of a Mr. Butler, near Petersburgh. She is stout
      and robust, has issue a daughter, 
      <span id="page-120" class="pagenum">[ 120 ]</span> jet black, by a black man. I am not informed as to her eye sight. The seventh instance
      is of a male belonging to a Mr. Lee, of Cumberland. His eyes are tremulous and weak.
      He is tall of stature, and now advanced in years. He is the only male of the Albinos
      which have come within my information. Whatever be the cause of the disease in the
      skin, or in its colouring matter, which produces this change, it seems more incident
      to the female than male sex. To these I may add the mention of a negro man within
      my own knowledge, born black, and of black parents; on whose chin, when a boy, a white
      spot appeared. This continued to increase till he became a man, by which time it had
      extended over his chin, lips, one cheek, the under jaw and neck on that side. It is
      of the Albino white, without any mixture of red, and has for several years been stationary.
      He is robust and healthy, and the change of colour was not accompanied with any sensible
      disease, either general or topical.

   <p id="xw20aab3d738">Of our fish and insects there has been nothing like a full description or collection.
      More of them are described in Catesby than in any other work. Many also are to be

The 
<span id="page-121" class="pagenum">[ 121 ]</span>
 honey-bee is not a native of our continent. Marcgrave <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d738b8" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d738b8" class="addEditorial">Actually Georg Marcgraf (1610-1644), whose <i id="xw20aab3d738b8b1">Historia Naturalis Brasiliae</i> was in Jefferson's library.</span> indeed mentions a species of honey-bee in Brasil. But this has no sting, and is therefore
      different from the one we have, which resembles perfectly that of Europe. The Indians
      concur with us in the tradition that it was brought from Europe; but when, and by
      whom, we know not. The bees have generally extended themselves into the country, a
      little in advance of the white settlers. The Indians therefore call them the white
      man's fly, and consider their approach as indicating the approach of the settlements
      of the whites. A question here occurs, How far northwardly have these insects been
      found? That they are unknown in Lapland, I infer from Scheffer's information, that
      the Laplanders eat the pine bark, prepared in a certain way, instead of those things
      sweetened with sugar. 'Hoc comedunt pro rebus saccharo conditis.' Scheff. Lapp. c.

         the place of things made of sugar."</span> Certainly, if they had honey, it would be a better substitute for sugar than any
      preparation of the pine bark. <div id="xw20aab3d738c12" class="marginNote">I. 126.</div>  Kalm tells us the honey bee cannot live through the winter in Canada. They furnish
      then an additional proof of the remarkable fact first observed by the Count de Buffon,
      and which has thrown such a blaze of light on the field of natural history, that no
      animals are found in both continents, but

   <p id="xw20aab3d746">Under the latitude of this query, I will presume it not improper nor unacceptable
      to furnish some data for estimating the climate of Virginia. Journals of observations
      on the quantity of rain, and degree of heat, being lengthy, confused, and too minute
      to produce general and distinct ideas, I have taken five years observations, to wit,
      from 1772 to 1777, made in Williamsburgh and its neighbourhood, have reduced them
      to an average for every month in the year, and stated those averages in the following
      table, adding an analytical view of the winds during the same period.

    <p>Memorandum of observations made by Gen<i>l</i> Dearborn</p>
    <p id="xw20aab3d750b1b5c12">In the month of August 1801 I carefully examined the temperature of my well water in the district of maine, and found it at 52 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer&#8211;<br/>
    the depth of the well is 28 feet; the depth of the water at this time was 4 feet; the latitude of the place is 44 22 N. Long. about 69 40 W.
    </p>
    <p id="xw20aab3d750b1b5c14">In Sept. 1802, I examined with the same instrument, and with equal care, the temperature
    of the well water where I live on the Capitol hill, and found it at 59° of Fahrenheit.
    This well is upwards of 40 feet in depth, and had at the time about 7 or 8 feet of
    water.
    </p>
    <p id="xw20aab3d750b1b5c16">My well in Maine is an open draw well without a pump. the well on the Capitol hill has a pump &amp; is close covered.
    </p>
    <p id="xw20aab3d750b1b5c18">The temperature of the water of Kennebeck river, the latter part of August, was 72½ by Fahrenheit.

   <p id="xw20aab3d785">The rains of every month, (as of January for instance) through the whole period of
      years, were added separately, and an average drawn from them. The coolest and warmest
      point of the same day in each year of the period were added separately, and an average
      of the greatest cold and greatest heat of that day, was formed. From the averages
      of every day in the month, a general average for the whole month was formed. The point
      from which the wind blew was observed two or three times in every day. These observations,
      in the month of January for instance, through the whole period amounted to 337. At
      73 of these, the wind was from the North; at 47, from the Northeast, &amp;c. So that it
      will be easy to see in what proportion each wind usually prevails in each month: or,
      taking the whole year, the total of observations through the whole period having been
      3698, it will be observed that 611 of them were from the North, 558 from the North-east,
      &amp;c.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d787">Though by this table it appears we have on an average 47 inches of rain annually,
      which is considerably more than usually falls in Europe, yet from the information
      I have collected, I suppose we have a much greater proportion of sunshine here than
      there. Perhaps it will be found there are twice as <span id="page-125" class="pagenum">[ 125 ]</span> many cloudy days in the middle parts of Europe, as in the United States of America.
      I mention the middle parts of Europe, because my information does not extend to its
      northern or southern parts.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d789">In an extensive country, it will of course be expected that the climate is not the
      same in all its parts. It is remarkable that, proceeding on the same parallel of latitude
      westwardly, the climate becomes colder in like manner as when you proceed northwardly.
      This continues to be the case till you attain the summit of the Alleghaney, which
      is the highest land between the ocean and the Missisipi. From thence, descending in
      the same latitude to the Missisipi, the change reverses; and, if we may believe travellers,
      it becomes warmer there than it is in the same latitude on the sea side. Their testimony
      is strengthened by the vegetables and animals which subsist and multiply there naturally,
      and do not on our sea coast. Thus Catalpas grow spontaneously on the Missisipi, as
      far as the latitude of 37°. and reeds as far as 38°. Perroquets even winter on the
      Sioto, in the 39th degree of latitude. In the summer of 1779, when the thermometer
      was at 90°. at Monticello, and 96 at Williamsburgh, it was 110°. at Kaskaskia. Perhaps
      the mountain, which overhangs this village on the <span id="page-126" class="pagenum">[ 126 ]</span> North side, may, by its reflexion, have contributed somewhat to produce this heat.
      The difference of temperature of the air at the sea coast, or on Chesapeak bay, and
      at the Alleghaney, has not been ascertained; but cotemporary observations, made at
      Williamsburgh; or in its neighbourhood, and at Monticello, which is on the most eastern
      ridge of mountains, called the South West, where they are intersected by the Rivanna,
      have furnished a ratio by which that difference may in some degree be conjectured.
      These observations make the difference between Williamsburgh and the nearest mountains,
      at the position before mentioned, to be on an average 6&#8539; degrees of Farenheit's thermometer.
      Some allowance however is to be made for the difference of latitude between these
      two places, the latter being 38°. 8'. 17". which is 52'. 22". North of the former.
      By cotemporary observations of between five and six weeks, the averaged and almost
      unvaried difference of the height of mercury in the barometer, at those two places,
      was .784 of an inch, the atmosphere at Monticello being so much the lightest, that
      is to say, about ¹&#8260;&#8323;&#8327; of its whole weight. It should be observed, however, that the
      hill of Monticello is of 500 feet perpendicular height above the river which washes
      its base. <span id="page-127" class="pagenum">[ 127 ]</span> This position being nearly central between our northern and southern boundaries,
      and between the bay and Alleghaney, may be considered as furnishing the best average
      of the temperature of our climate. Williamsburgh is much too near the South-eastern
      corner to give a far idea of our general temperature.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d791">But a more remarkable difference is in the winds which prevail in the different parts
      of the country. The following table exhibits a comparative view of the winds prevailing
      at Williamsburgh, and at Monticello. It is formed by reducing nine months observations
      at Monticello to four principal points, to wit, the North-east, South-east, South-west,
      and North-west; these points being perpendicular to, or parallel with our coast, mountains
      and rivers: and by reducing, in like manner, an equal number of observations, to wit,
      421. from the preceding table of winds at Williamsburgh, taking them proportionably
      from every point.

   <p id="xw20aab3d795">By this it may be seen that the South-west wind prevails equally at both places; that
      <span id="page-128" class="pagenum">[ 128 ]</span> the North-east is, next to this, the principal wind towards the sea coast, and the
      North-west is the predominant wind at the mountains. The difference between these
      two winds to sensation, and in fact, is very great. The North-east is loaded with
      vapour, insomuch, that the salt makers have found that their crystals would not shoot
      while that blows; it brings a distressing chill, is heavy and oppressive to the spirits:
      the North-west is dry, cooling, elastic and animating. The Eastern and South-eastern
      breezes come on generally in the afternoon. They have advanced into the country very
      sensibly within the memory of people now living. They formerly did not penetrate far
      above Williamsburgh. They are now frequent at Richmond, and every now and then reach
      the mountains. They deposit most of their moisture however before they get that far.
      As the lands become more cleared, it is probable they will extend still further westward.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d797">Going out into the open air, in the temperate, and in the warm months of the year,
      we often meet with bodies of warm air, which, passing by us in two or three seconds,
      do not afford time to the most sensible thermometer to seize their temperature. Judging
      from my feelings only, I think they approach the ordinary heat of the human body.
      <span id="page-129" class="pagenum">[ 129 ]</span> Some of them perhaps go a little beyond it. They are of about 20 or 30 feet diameter
      horizontally. Of their height we have no experience; but probably they are globular
      volumes wafted or rolled along with the wind. But whence taken, where found, or or
      how generated? They are not to be ascribed to Volcanos, because we have none. They
      do not happen in the winter when the farmers kindle large fires in clearing up their
      grounds. They are not confined to the spring season, when we have fires which traverse
      whole counties, consuming the leaves which have fallen from the trees. And they are
      too frequent and general to be ascribed to accidental fires. I am persuaded their
      cause must be sought for in the atmosphere itself to aid us in which I know but of
      these constant circumstances; a dry air; a temperature as warm at least as that of
      the spring or autumn; and a moderate current of wind. They are most frequent about
      sun-set; rare in the middle parts of the day; and I do not recollect having ever met
      with them in the morning.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d799">The variation in the weight of our atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, is not
      equal to two inches of mercury. During twelve months observation at Williamsburgh,
the extremes were 29, and 30.86 inches, the <span id="page-130" class="pagenum">[ 130 ]</span>
 difference being 1.86 of an inch: and in nine months, during which the height of
      the mercury was noted at Monticello, the extremes were 28.48 and 29.69 inches, the
      variation being 1.21 of an inch. A gentleman, who has observed his barometer many
      years, assures me it has never varied two inches. Cotemporary observations, made at
      Monticello and Williamsburgh, proved the variations in the weight of air to be simultaneous
      and corresponding in these two places.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d801">Our changes from heat to cold, and cold to heat, are very sudden and great. The mercury
      in Farenheit's thermometer has been known to descend from 92°. to 47°. in thirteen
      hours.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d803">It is taken for granted, that the preceding table of averaged heat will not give a
      false idea on this subject, as it proposes to state only the ordinary heat and cold
      of each month, and not those which are extraordinary. At Williamsburgh in August 1766,
      the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer was at 98°. corresponding with 29&#8531; of Reaumur.
      <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d803b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d803b1" class="addEditorial">René Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur (1683-1757), French naturalist who invented a thermometer
         with a scale in which 0° was the freezing point and 80° the boiling point of water.</span> At the same place in January 1780, it was at 6°. corresponding with 11½  below 0.
      of Reaumur. I believe * these may be 
      <span id="xw20aab3d803b3" class="authorNote">* At Paris, in 1753, the mercury in Reaumur's thermometer was at 30½ above 0, and
         in 1776, it was</span>  
      <span id="page-131" class="pagenum">[ 131 ]</span> considered to be nearly the extremes of heat and cold in that part of the country.
      The latter may most certainly, as, at that time, York river, at York town, was frozen
      over, so that people walked across it; a circumstance which proves it to have been
      colder than the winter of 1740, 1741, usually called the cold winter, when York river
      did not freeze over at that place. In the same season of 1780, Chesapeak bay was solid,
      from its head to the mouth of Patowmac. At Annapolis, where it is 5¼ miles over between
      the nearest points of land, the ice was from 5 to 7 inches thick quite across, so
      that loaded carriages went over on it. Those, our extremes of heat and cold, of 6°.
      and 98°. were indeed very distressing to us, and were thought to put the extent of
      the human constitution to considerable trial. Yet a Siberian would have considered
      them as scarcely a sensible variation. At Jenniseitz in that country, in latitude
      58°. 27'. we are told, that the cold in 1735 sunk the mercury by Farenheit's scale
      to 126°. below nothing; and the inhabitants of the same country use stove rooms two
      or three times a week, in which they stay two hours at a time, the 
      <span id="xw20aab3d803b7" class="authorNote">at 16 below 0. The extremities of heat and cold therefore at Paris, are greater than
         at Williamsburgh, which is in the hottest part of Virginia.</span>
      <span id="page-132" class="pagenum">[ 132 ]</span>
 atmosphere of which raises the mercury to 135°. above nothing. Late experiments shew
      that the human body will exist in rooms heated to 140°. of Reaumur, equal to 347°.
      of Farenheit, and 135°. above boiling water. The hottest point of the 24 hours is
      about four o'clock, P. M. and the dawn of day the coldest.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d805">The access of frost in autumn, and its recess in the spring, do not seem to depend
      merely on the degree of cold; much less on the air's being at the freezing point.
      White frosts are frequent when the thermometer is at 47°. have killed young plants
      of Indian corn at 48°. and have been known at 54°. Black frost, and even ice, have
      been produced at 38½°, which is 6½ degrees above the freezing point. That other circumstances
      must be combined with the cold to produce frost, is evident from this also, that on
      the higher parts of mountains, where it is absolutely colder than in the plains on
      which they stand, frosts do not appear so early by a considerable space of time in
      autumn, and go off sooner in the spring, than in the plains. I have known frosts so
      severe as to kill the hiccory trees round about Monticello, and yet not injure the
      tender fruit blossoms then in bloom on the top and higher parts of the mountain; and

    <p id="xw20aab3d805b6">
    * The following observations on heat and cold, as they affect the animal body, may
    not be unacceptable to those who have not paid particular attention to the subject.
    </p>
    <p id="xw20aab3d805b8">The living body (not like the dead one, which assumes the temperature of the surrounding
    atmosphere) maintains within itself a steady heat of about 96°. of Fareheit's thermometer,
    varying little with the ordinary variations of the atmosphere. this heat is principally
    supplied by respiration. the vital air, or oxygen of the atmospheric fluid inhaled,
    is separated by the lungs from the azotic &amp; carbonic parts, and is absorbed by them;
    the caloric is disengaged, diffused thro' the mass of the body, and absorbed from
    the skin by the external air coming into contact with it. if the external air is of
    a high temperature, it does not take up the superfluous heat of the body fast enough,
    and we complain of too much heat: if it is very cold, it absorbs the heat too fast,
    &amp; produces the sensation of cold. to remedy this, we interpose a covering, which acting
    as a strainer, lets less air come into contact with the body, and checks the escape
    of the vital heat. as the atmospheric air becomes colder, more or thicker coverings
    are used, till no more than the requisite portion of heat is conducted from the body.
    as it would be inconvenient in the day to be burthened with a mass of clothing entirely
    equivalent to great degrees of cold, we have resort to fires and warm rooms to correct
    the state of the atmosphere, as a supplement to our clothing. if we have not the opportunity,
    and the cold is excessive, the thinner parts, as the ear, the nose, the fingers and
    toes lose heat till they freeze, and, if the cold be sufficient, the whole body is
    reduced in heat, till death ensues: as sailors experience who escape from shipwreck,
    in winter storms, on desert shores, where no fire can be found.
    </p>
<span id="page-t-i_19_page_2" class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 19, Page 2 ]</span>
      <p id="xw20aab3d805c17">Of the substances we use for covering, linen seems the openest strainer for admission
         of air to the body, and the most copious conductor of heat from it; and is therefore
         considered as a cool clothing. cotton obstructs still more the passage of both fluids;
         and wool more than cotton: it is called therefore a worse conductor of heat, and warmer
         clothing. next to this are the furs, and the most impermeable of all for heat and
         air are feathers and down, and especially the down of the Eider duck. (Anas mollissima.)
         hence the insensibility to cold of the beasts with shaggy hair, or fine fur, and of
         the birds in proportion as they are provided with down and soft feathers, as the swan,
         goose, and duck.
      </p>
      <p id="xw20aab3d805c19">Among the substances which, as being bad conductors of heat, foment and warm the animal
         body, are the leaves of the Espeletia Frailexon, a plant newly discovered by the great
         naturalist and traveller Baron Humboldt, on the mountains of S. America, at the height
         of 2450. toises above the sea. these leaves being furnished abundantly with a soft
         down, restore immediately to their due warmth the hands, feet, or other members benumbed
         with cold; and collected as a bed, protect from death the Indian benighted in those
         regions of extreme cold. the same scientific traveller, by analysis of the air, at
         different heights on the mountain of Chimborazo which he ascended to the height of
         3036 toises (546 toises higher than had ever been done by man before, and within 224
         toises of it's top) found that the oxygen being specifically heavier than the azotic
         part of the atmosphere, it's proportion lessened in that ascent 27. or 28. to 19½
         hundredth parts. The same circumstance had been before observed by Saussure, Pini
         &amp; Rebout on the high mountains of Europe, and must be among the principal causes of
         the degree in which the animal body is affected with cold in situations more or less
         elevated.
      </p>
      <span id="page-t-i_19_page_3" class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 19, Page 3 ]</span>
      <p id="xw20aab3d805c29">In addition to the effect of vital air, as the vehicle of animal heat, we may note
         that it is also the immediate cause, or primum mobile of life. for, entering by respiration
         into the air cells of the lungs, divided from those of the blood but by a thin membrane,
         it infuses thro' that a stimulus into the blood, which, acting on the irritable fibres
         of the heart, excites mechanically the action and reaction of that muscle. by these
         the blood is propelled, and received again in a course of constant circulation and
         vital action communicated and maintained thro' all the system. intercept vital air
         from the lungs, the action of the heart ceases for want of stimulus, the current of
         the blood, unaided, yields to the resistance of it's channels, all the vital motions
         are suspended, &amp; body becomes an inanimated lump of matter.

 course of 40 years, during which it has been settled, there have been but two instances
      of a general loss of fruit on it: while, in the circumjacent country, the fruit has
      escaped but twice in the last seven years. The plants of tobacco, which grow from
      the roots of those which have been cut off in the summer, are frequently green here
      at Christmas. This privilege against the frost is undoubtedly combined with the want
      of dew on the mountains. That the dew is very rare on their higher parts, I may say
      with certainty, from 12 years observations, having scarcely ever, during that time,
      seen an unequivocal proof of its existence on them at all during summer. Severe frosts
      in the depth of winter prove that the region of dews extends higher in that season
      than the tops of the mountains: but certainly, in the summer season, the vapours,
      by the time they attain that height, are become so attenuated as not to subside and
      form a dew when the sun retires.

   <p id="xw20aab3d809">A more satisfactory estimate of our climate to some, may perhaps be formed, by noting
      the plants which grow here, subject however to be killed by our severest colds. These
      are the fig, pomegranate, artichoke, <span id="page-134" class="pagenum">[ 134 ]</span> and European walnut. In mild winters, lettuce and endive require no shelter; but
      generally they need a slight covering. I do not know that the want of long moss, reed,
      myrtle, swamp laurel, holly and cypress, in the upper country, proceeds from a greater
      degree of cold, nor that they were ever killed with any degree of cold in the lower
      country. The aloe lived in Williamsburgh in the open air through the severe winter
      of 1779, 1780.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d811">A change in our climate however is taking place very sensibly. Both heats and colds
      are become much more moderate within the memory even of the middle-aged. Snows are
      less frequent and less deep. They do not often lie, below the mountains, more than
      one, two, or three days, and very rarely a week. They are remembered to have been
      formerly frequent, deep, and of long continuance. The elderly inform me the earth
      used to be covered with snow about three months in every year. The rivers, which then
      seldom failed to freeze over in the course of the winter, scarcely ever do so now.
      This change has produced an unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold, in the
      spring of the year, which is very fatal to fruits. From the year 1741 to 1769, an
interval of twenty-eight years, there was no instance of fruit <span id="page-135" class="pagenum">[ 135 ]</span>
 killed by the frost in the neighbourhood of Monticello. An intense cold, produced
      by constant snows, kept the buds locked up till the sun could obtain, in the spring
      of the year, so fixed an ascendency as to dissolve those snows, and protect the buds,
      during their developement, from every danger of returning cold. The accumulated snows
      of the winter remaining to be dissolved all together in the spring, produced those
      overflowings of our rivers, so frequent then, and so rare now.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d813">Having had occasion to mention the particular situation of Monticello for other purposes,
      I will just take notice that its elevation affords an opportunity of seeing a phænomenon
      which is rare at land, though frequent at sea. The seamen call it <i id="xw20aab3d813b1">looming</i>. Philosophy is as yet in the rear of the seamen, for so far from having accounted
      for it, she has not given it a name. Its principal effect is to make distant objects
      appear larger, in opposition to the general law of vision, by which they are diminished.
      I knew an instance, at York town, from whence the water prospect eastwardly is without
      termination, wherein a canoe with three men, at a great distance, was taken for a
      ship with its three masts. I am little acquainted with the phænomenon as it shews
      <span id="page-136" class="pagenum">[ 136 ]</span> itself at sea; but at Monticello it is familiar. There is a solitary mountain about
      40 miles off, in the South, whose natural shape, as presented to view there, is a
      regular cone; but, by the effect of looming, it sometimes subsides almost totally
      into the horizon; sometimes it rises more acute and more elevated; sometimes it is
      hemispherical; and sometimes its sides are perpendicular, its top flat, and as broad
      as its base. In short it assumes at times the most whimsical shapes, and all these
      perhaps successively in the same morning. The Blue ridge of mountains comes into view,
      in the North East, at about 100 miles distance, and, approaching in a direct line,
      passes by within 20 miles, and goes off to the South-west. This phenomenon begins
      to shew itself on these mountains, at about 50 miles distance, and continues beyond
      that as far as they are seen. I remark no particular state, either in the weight,
      moisture, or heat of the atmosphere, necessary to produce this. The only constant
      circumstances are, its appearance in the morning only, and on objects at least 40
      or 50 miles distant. In this latter circumstance, if not in both, it differs from
      the looming on the water. Refraction will not account for this metamorphosis. That
      only changes the proportions of length and <span id="page-137" class="pagenum">[ 137 ]</span> breadth, base and altitude, preserving the general outlines. Thus it may make a circle
      appear elliptical, raise or depress a cone, but by none of its laws, as yet developed,
      will it make a circle appear a square, or a cone a sphere.

      extracted from our historians and public records, as particularly as I have had opportunities
      and leisure to examine them. Successive lines in the same year shew successive periods
      of time in that year. I have stated the census in two different columns, the whole
      inhabitants having been sometimes numbered, and sometimes the <i>tythes</i> only. This term,
      with us, includes the free males above 16 years of age, and slaves above that age
      of both sexes. A further examination of our records would render this history of our
      population much more satisfactory and perfect, by furnishing a greater number of intermediate
      terms.

      render the progression fluctuating and irregular. By the year 1654, however, it becomes
      tolerably uniform, importations having in a great measure ceased from the dissolution
      of the company, and the inhabitants become too numerous to be sensibly affected by
      Indian wars. <span id="page-139" class="pagenum">[ 139 ]</span> Beginning at that period, therefore, we find that from thence to the year 1772, our
      tythes had increased from 7209 to 155,000. The whole term being of 118 years, yields
      a duplication once in every 27 ¹⁄₄ years. The intermediate enumerations taken in 1700,
      1748, and 1759, furnish proofs of the uniformity of this progression. Should this
      rate of increase continue, we shall have between six and seven millions of inhabitants
      within 95 years. If we suppose our country to be bounded, at some future day, by the
      meridian of the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, (within which it has been before conjectured,
      are 64,491 square miles) there will then be 100 inhabitants for every square mile,
      which is nearly the state of population in the British islands.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d833">Here I will beg leave to propose a doubt. The present desire of America is to produce
      rapid population by as great importations of foreigners as possible. But is this founded
      in good policy? The advantage proposed is the multiplication of numbers. Now let us
      suppose (for example only) that, in this state, we could double our numbers in one
      year by the importation of foreigners; and this is a greater accession than the most
      sanguine advocate for emigration has a right to expect. Then I say, beginning with
      a double stock, <span id="page-140" class="pagenum">[ 140 ]</span>  we shall attain any given degree of population only 27 years and 3 months sooner
      than if we proceed on our single stock. If we propose four millions and a half as
      a competent population for this state, we should be 54½ years attaining it, could
      we at once double our numbers; and 81¾  years, if we rely on natural propagation,
      as may be seen by the following table.

      at each period, as they will be if we proceed on our actual stock; and in the third
      are what they would be, at the same periods, were we to set out from the double of
      our present stock. I have taken the term of four millions and a half of inhabitants
      for example's sake only. Yet I am persuaded it is a greater number than the country
      spoken of, considering how much inarrable land it contains, can clothe and feed, without
      a material change in the quality of their diet. But are there no inconveniences to
      be thrown into <span id="page-141" class="pagenum">[ 141 ]</span> the scale against the advantage expected from a multiplication of numbers by the
      importation of foreigners? It is for the happiness of those united in society to harmonize
      as much as possible in matters which they must of necessity transact together. Civil
      government being the sole object of forming societies, its administration must be
      conducted by common consent. Every species of government has its specific principles.
      Ours perhaps are more peculiar than those of any other in the universe. It is a composition
      of the freest principles of the English constitution, with others derived from natural
      right and natural reason. To these nothing can be more opposed than the maxims of
      absolute monarchies. Yet, from such, we are to expect the greatest number of emigrants.
      They will bring with them the principles of the governments they leave, imbibed in
      their early youth; or, if able to throw them off, it will be in exchange for an unbounded
      licentiousness, passing, as is usual, from one extreme to another. It would be a miracle
      were they to stop precisely at the point of temperate liberty. These principles, with
      their language, they will transmit to their children. In proportion to their numbers,
      they will share with us the legislation. They will infuse into it <span id="page-142" class="pagenum">[ 142 ]</span> their  spirit, warp and bias its direction, and render it a heterogeneous, incoherent,
      distracted mass. I may appeal to experience, during the present contest, for a verification
      of these conjectures. But, if they be not certain in event, are they not possible,
      are they not probable? Is it not safer to wait with patience 27 years and three months
      longer, for the attainment of any degree of population desired, or expected?  May
      not our government be more homogeneous, more peaceable, more durable? Suppose 20 millions
      of republican Americans thrown all of a sudden into France, what would be the condition
      of that kingdom? If it would be more turbulent, less happy, less strong, we may believe
      that the addition of half a million of foreigners to our present numbers would produce
      a similar effect here. If they come of themselves, they are entitled to all the rights
      of citizenship: but I doubt the expediency of inviting them by extraordinary encouragements.
      I mean not that these doubts should be extended to the importation of useful artificers.
      The policy of that measure depends on very different considerations. Spare no expence
      in obtaining them. They will after a while go to the plough and the hoe; but, in the
      mean time, they will teach us something we do not know. It is not so <span id="page-143" class="pagenum">[ 143 ]</span> in agriculture. The indifferent state of that among us does not proceed from a want
      of knowledge merely; it is from our having such quantities of land to waste as we
      please. In Europe the object is to make the most of their land, labour being abundant:
      here it is to make the most of our labour, land being abundant.

   <p id="xw20aab3d843">There were no returns from the 8 counties of Lincoln, Jefferson, Fayette, Monongalia,
      Yohogania, Ohio, Northampton, and York. To find the number of slaves which should
      <span id="page-144" class="pagenum">[ 144 ]</span> have been returned instead of the 23,766 titheables, we must mention that some observations
      on a former census had given reason to believe that the numbers above and below 16
      years of age were equal. The double of this number, therefore, to wit, 47,532 must
      be added to 211,698, which will give us 259,230 slaves of all ages and sexes. To find
      the number of free inhabitants, we must repeat the observation, that those above and
      below 16 are nearly equal. But as the number 53,289 omits the males between 16 and
      21, we must supply them from conjecture. On a former experiment it had appeared that
      about one-third of our militia, that is, of the males between 16 and 50, were unmarried.
      Knowing how early marriage takes place here, we shall not be far wrong in supposing
      that the unmarried part of our militia are those between 16 and 21. If there be young
      men who do not marry till after 21, there are as many who marry before that age. But
      as the men above 50 were not included in the militia, we will suppose the unmarried,
      or those between 16 and 21, to be one-fourth of the whole number above 16, then we
      have the following calculation:
   </p>
   <p><span id="page-145" class="pagenum">[ 145 ]</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d846">53,289 &#8199; free males above 21 years of age.</p>

   <p id="xw20aab3d856">259,230 &#8199; slaves of all ages.</p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d858">543,433 &#8199; inhabitants, exclusive of the 8 counties from which were no returns. In
      these 8 counties in the years 1779 and 1780 were 3,161 militia. Say then,
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d860">3,161 &#8199; free males above the age of 16. </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d862">3,161 &#8199; ditto under 16. </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d864">6,322 &#8199; free females.</p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d866">12,644 &#8199; free inhabitants in these 8 counties. To find the number of slaves, say,
      as 284,208 to 259,230, so is 12,644 to 11,532. Adding the third of these numbers to
      the first, and the fourth to the second, we have,
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d868">296,852 &#8199; free inhabitants.</p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d870">270,762 &#8199; slaves.</p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d872">567,614 &#8199; inhabitants of every age, sex, and condition. But 296,852, the number of
      free inhabitants, are to 270,762, the number of slaves, nearly as 11 to 10. Under
      the mild treatment our slaves experience, and their wholesome, though coarse, food,
this blot in our country increases as fast, or faster, than <span id="page-146" class="pagenum">[ 146 ]</span>
 the 
      the whites. During the regal government, we had at one time obtained a law, which
      imposed such a duty on the importation of slaves, as amounted nearly to a prohibition,
      when one inconsiderate assembly, placed under a peculiarity of circumstance, repealed
      the law. This repeal met a joyful sanction from the then sovereign, and no devices,
      no expedients, which could ever after be attempted by subsequent assemblies, and they
      seldom met without attempting them, could succeed in getting the royal assent to a
      renewal of the duty. In the very first session held under the republican government,
      the assembly passed a law for the perpetual prohibition of the importation of slaves.
      This will in some measure stop the increase of this great political and moral evil,
      while the minds of our citizens may be ripening for a complete emancipation of human
      nature.

   <p id="xw20aab3d892">Every able-bodied freeman, between the ages of 16 and 50, is enrolled in the militia.
      Those of every county are formed into companies, and these again into one or more
      battalions, according to the numbers in the county. They are commanded by colonels,
      <span id="page-148" class="pagenum">[ 148 ]</span> and other subordinate officers, as in the regular service. In every county is a county-lieutenant, who commands the whole militia of his county, but ranks only as a colonel
      in the field. We have no general officers always existing. These are appointed occasionally,
      when an invasion or insurrection happens, and their commission determines with the
      occasion. The governor is head of the military, as well as civil power. The law requires
      every militia-man to provide himself with the arms usual in the regular service. But
      this injunction was always indifferently complied with, and the arms they had have
      been so frequently called for to arm the regulars, that in the lower parts of the
      country they are entirely disarmed. In the middle country a fourth or fifth part of
      them may have such firelocks as they had provided to destroy the noxious animals which
      infest their farms; and on the western side of the Blue ridge they are generally armed
      with rifles. The pay of our militia, as well as of our regulars, is that of the Continental
      regulars. The condition of our regulars, of whom we have none but Continentals, and
      part of a battalion of state troops, is so constantly on the change, that a state
      of it at this day would not be its state a month hence. It is much the same with the
      <span id="page-149" class="pagenum">[ 149 ]</span> condition of the other Continental troops, which is well enough known.

   <p id="xw20aab3d906">A DESCRIPTION of the Indians established in that state?
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d908">When the first effectual settlement of our colony was made, which was in 1607, the
      country from the sea-coast to the mountains, and from Patowmac to the most southern
      waters of James river, was occupied by upwards of forty different tribes of Indians.
      Of these the <i id="xw20aab3d908b1">Powhatans</i>, the <i id="xw20aab3d908b3">Mannahoacs</i>, and <span id="page-150" class="pagenum">[ 150 ]</span> <i id="xw20aab3d908b7">Monacans</i>, were the most powerful. Those between the sea-coast and falls of the rivers, were
      in amity with one another, and attached to the <i id="xw20aab3d908b9">Powhatans</i> as their link of union. Those between the falls of the rivers and the mountains,
      were divided into two confederacies; the tribes inhabiting the head waters of Patowmac
      and Rappahanoc being attached to the <i id="xw20aab3d908c11">Mannahoacs</i>; and those on the upper parts of James river to the <i id="xw20aab3d908c13">Monacans</i>. But the <i id="xw20aab3d908c15">Monacans</i> and their friends were in amity with the <i id="xw20aab3d908c17">Mannahoacs</i> and their friends, and waged joint and perpetual war against the <i id="xw20aab3d908c19">Powhatans</i>. We are told that the <i id="xw20aab3d908c21">Powhatans</i>, <i id="xw20aab3d908c23">Mannahoacs</i>, and <i id="xw20aab3d908c25">Monacans</i>, spoke languages so radically different, that interpreters were necessary when they
      transacted business. Hence we may conjecture, that this was not the case between all
      the tribes, and probably that each spoke the language of the nation to which it was
      attached; which we know to have been the case in many particular instances. Very possibly
      there may have been antiently three different stocks, each of which multiplying in
      a long course of time, had separated into so many little societies. This practice
      results from the circumstance of their having never submitted themselves to any laws,
      any coercive power, any shadow of government. Their only controuls are their <span id="page-151" class="pagenum">[ 151 ]</span> manners, and that moral sense of right and wrong, which, like the sense of tasting
      and feeling, in every man makes a part of his nature. An offence against these is
      punished by contempt, by exclusion from society, or, where the case is serious, as
      that of murder, by the individuals whom it concerns. Imperfect as this species of
      coercion may seem, crimes are very rare among them: insomuch that were it made a question,
      whether no law, as among the savage Americans, or too much law, as among the civilized
      Europeans, submits man to the greatest evil, one who has seen both conditions of existence
      would pronounce it to be the last: and that the sheep are happier of themselves, than
      under care of the wolves. It will be said, that great societies cannot exist without
      government. The Savages therefore break them into small ones.

   <p id="xw20aab3d910">The territories of the <i id="xw20aab3d910b1">Powhatan</i> confederacy, south of the Patowmac, comprehended about 8000 square miles, 30 tribes,
      and 2400 warriors. Capt. Smith tells us, that within 60 miles of James town were 5000
      people, of whom 1500 were warriors. From this we find the proportion of their warriors
      to their whole inhabitants, was as 3 to 10. The <i id="xw20aab3d910b3">Powhatan</i> confederacy then would consist of <span id="page-152" class="pagenum">[ 152 ]</span> about 8000 inhabitants, which was one for every square mile; being about the twentieth
      part of our present population in the same territory, and the hundredth of that of
      the British islands.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d912">Besides these, were the <i id="xw20aab3d912b1">Nottoways</i>, living on Nottoway river, the <i id="xw20aab3d912b3">Meherrins</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d912b5">Tuteloes</i> on Meherrin river, who were connected with the Indians of Carolina, probably with
      the Chowanocs.

   <p id="xw20aab3d922">The preceding table contains a state of these several tribes, according to their confederacies
      and geographical situation, with their numbers when we first became acquainted with
      them, where these numbers are known. The numbers of some of them are again stated
      as they were in the year 1669, when an attempt was made by the assembly to enumerate
      them. Probably the enumeration is imperfect, and in some measure conjectural, and
      that a further search into the records would furnish many more particulars. What would
      be the melancholy sequel of their history, may however be augured from the census
      of 1669; by which we discover that the tribes therein enumerated were, in the space
      of 61 years, reduced to about one-third of their former numbers. Spirituous liquors,
      the small-pox, war, and an abridgment of territory, to a people who lived principally
      on the spontaneous productions of nature, had committed terrible havock among them,
      which generation, under the obstacles opposed to it among them, was not likely to
      make good. That the lands of this country were taken from them by conquest, is not
      so general a truth as is supposed. I find in our historians and records, repeated
      proofs of purchase, which cover a considerable part of the lower country; and many
      <span id="page-154" class="pagenum">[ 154 ]</span> more would doubtless be found on further search. The upper country we know has been
      acquired altogether by purchases made in the most unexceptionable form.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d924">Westward of all these tribes, beyond the mountains, and extending to the great lakes,
      were the <i id="xw20aab3d924b1">Massawomecs</i>, a most powerful confederacy, who harrassed unremittingly the <i id="xw20aab3d924b3">Powhatans</i> and <i id="xw20aab3d924b5">Manahoacs</i>. These were probably the ancestors of the tribes known at present by the name of
      the <i id="xw20aab3d924b7">Six Nations</i>.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d926">Very little can now be discovered of the subsequent history of these tribes severally.
      The <i id="xw20aab3d926b1">Chickahominies</i> removed, about the year 1661, to Mattapony river. Their chief, with one from each
      of the tribes of the Pamunkies and Mattaponies, attended the treaty of Albany in 1685.
      This seems to have been the last chapter in their history. They retained however their
      separate name so late as 1705, and were at length blended with the Pamunkies and Mattaponies,
      and exist at present only under their names. There remain of the <i id="xw20aab3d926b3">Mattaponies</i> three or four men only, and they have more negro than Indian blood in them. They
      have lost their language, have reduced themselves, by voluntary sales, to about fifty
      acres of land, which lie on the river of their own name, and have, from time to time,
      been joining the Pamunkies, from 
      <span id="page-155" class="pagenum">[ 155 ]</span> whom they are distant but 10 miles. The <i id="xw20aab3d926b7">Pamunkies</i> are reduced to about 10 or 12 men, tolerably pure from mixture with other colours.
      The older ones among them preserve their language in a small degree, which are the
      last vestiges on earth, as far as we know, of the Powhatan language. They have about
      300 acres of very fertile land, on Pamunkey river, so encompassed by water that a
      gate struts in the whole. Of the <i id="xw20aab3d926b9">Nottoways</i>, not a male is left. A few women constitute the remains of that tribe. They are seated
      on Nottoway river, in Southampton county, on very fertile lands. At a very early period,
      certain lands were marked out and appropriated to these tribes, and were kept from
      encroachment by the authority of the laws. They have usually had trustees appointed,
      whose duty was to watch over their interests, and guard them from insult and injury.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d928">The <i id="xw20aab3d928b1">Monacans</i> and their friends, better known latterly by the name of <i id="xw20aab3d928b3">Tuscaroras</i>, were probably connected with the Massawomecs, or Five Nations. For though we are
      * told their languages were so different that the intervention of interpreters was
      necessary between them, yet do we also &#8224; learn that the Erigas, a nation formerly
      inhabiting 
      <span id="xw20aab3d928b5" class="authorNote">* Smith.</span> 
      <span id="xw20aab3d928b7" class="authorNote">&#8224; Evans.</span> 
<span id="page-156" class="pagenum">[ 156 ]</span>
 on the Ohio, were of the same original stock with the Five Nations, and that they
      partook also of the Tuscarora language. Their dialects might, by long separation,
      have become so unlike as to be unintelligible to one another. We know that in 1712,
      the Five Nations received the Tuscaroras into their confederacy, and made them the
      Sixth Nation. They received the Meherrins and Tuteloes also into their protection:
      and it is most probable, that the remains of many other of the tribes, of whom we
      find no particular account, retired westwardly in like manner, and were incorporated
      with one or other of the western tribes. (5) 
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d930">I know of no such thing existing as an Indian monument: for I would not honour with
      that name arrow points, stone hatchets, stone pipes, and half-shapen images. Of labour
      on the large scale, I think there is no remain as respectable as would be a common
      ditch for the draining of lands: unless indeed it be the Barrows, of which many are
      to be found all over this country. These are of different sizes, some of them constructed
      of earth, and some of loose stones. That they were repositories of the dead, has been
      obvious to all: but on what particular occasion constructed, was matter of doubt.
      Some have thought they covered the bones of those who 
      <span id="page-157" class="pagenum">[ 157 ]</span> have fallen in battles fought on the spot of interment. Some ascribed them to the
      custom, said to prevail among the Indians, of collecting, at certain periods, the
      bones of all their dead, wheresoever deposited at the time of death. Others again
      supposed them the general sepulchres for towns, conjectured to have been on or near
      these grounds; and this opinion was supported by the quality of the lands in which
      they are found, (those constructed of earth being generally in the softest and most
      fertile meadow-grounds on river sides) and by a tradition, said to be handed down
      from the Aboriginal Indians, that, when they settled in a town, the first person who
      died was placed erect, and earth put about him, so as to cover and support him; that,
      when another died, a narrow passage was dug to the first, the second reclined against
      him, and the cover of earth replaced, and so on. There being one of these in my neighbourhood,
      I wished to satisfy myself whether any, and which of these opinions were just. For
      this purpose I determined to open and examine it thoroughly. It was situated on the
      low grounds of the Rivanna, about two miles above its principal fork, and opposite
      to some hills, on which had been an Indian town. It was of a spheroidical form, of
      about 40 feet diameter at the base, 
      <span id="page-158" class="pagenum">[ 158 ]</span> and had been of about twelve feet altitude, though now reduced by the plough to seven
      and a half, having been under cultivation about a dozen years. Before this it was
      covered with trees of twelve inches diameter, and round the base was an excavation
      of five feet depth and width, from whence the earth had been taken of which the hillock
      was formed. I first dug superficially in several parts of it, and came to collections
      of human bones, at different depths, from six inches to three feet below the surface.
      These were lying in the utmost confusion, some vertical, some oblique, some horizontal,
      and directed to every point of the compass, entangled, and held together in clusters
      by the earth. Bones of the most distant parts were found together, as, for instance,
      the small bones of the foot in the hollow of a scull, many sculls would sometimes
      be in contact, lying on the face, on the side, on the back, top or bottom, so as,
      on the whole, to give the idea of bones emptied promiscuously from a bag or basket,
      and covered over with earth, without any attention to their order. The bones of which
      the greatest numbers remained, were sculls, jaw-bones, teeth, the bones of the arms,
      thighs, legs, feet, and hands. A few ribs remained, some vertebræ of the neck and
      spine, without their processes, and 
      <span id="page-159" class="pagenum">[ 159 ]</span> one instance only of the * bone which serves as a base to the vertebral column. The
      sculls were so tender, that they generally fell to pieces on being touched. The other
      bones were stronger. There were some teeth which were judged to be smaller than those
      of an adult; a scull, which, on a slight view, appeared to be that of an infant, but
      it fell to pieces on being taken out, so as to prevent satisfactory examination; a
      rib, and a fragment of the under-jaw of a person about half grown; another rib of
      an infant; and part of the jaw of a child, which had not yet cut its teeth. This last
      furnishing the most decisive proof of the burial of children here, I was particular
      in my attention to it. It was part of the right-half of the under-jaw. The processes,
      by which it was articulated to the temporal bones, were entire; and the bone itself
      firm to where it had been broken off, which, as nearly as I could judge, was about
      the place of the eye-tooth. Its upper edge, wherein would have been the sockets of
      the teeth, was perfectly smooth. Measuring it with that of an adult, by placing their
      hinder processes together, its broken end extended to the penultimate grinder of the
      adult. This bone was white, all the others of a sand colour. The bones of infants
      being 
      <span id="xw20aab3d930b7" class="authorNote">* The os sacrum.</span>
      <span id="page-160" class="pagenum">[ 160 ]</span> soft, they probably decay sooner, which might be the cause so few were found here.
      I proceeded then to make a perpendicular cut through the body of the barrow, that
      I might examine its internal structure. This passed about three feet from its center,
      was opened to the former surface of the earth, and was wide enough for a man to walk
      through and examine its sides. At the bottom, that is, on the level of the circumjacent
      plain, I found bones; above these a few stones, brought from a cliff a quarter of
      a mile off, and from the river one-eighth of a mile off; then a large interval of
      earth, then a stratum of bones, and so on. At one end of the section were four strata
      of bones plainly distinguishable; at the other, three; the strata in one part not
      ranging with those in another. The bones nearest the surface were least decayed. No
      holes were discovered in any of them, as if made with bullets, arrows, or other weapons.
      I conjectured that in this barrow might have been a thousand skeletons. Every one
      will readily seize the circumstances above related, which militate against the opinion,
      that it covered the bones only of persons fallen in battle; and against the tradition
      also, which would make it the common sepulchre of a town, in which the bodies were
      placed upright, and touching each other. 
<span id="page-161" class="pagenum">[ 161 ]</span>
  Appearances certainly indicate that it has derived both origin and growth from the
      accustomary collection of bones, and deposition of them together; that the first collection
      had been deposited on the common surface of the earth, a few stones put over it, and
      then a covering of earth, that the second had been laid on this, had covered more
      or less of it in proportion to the number of bones, and was then also covered with
      earth; and so on. The following are the particular circumstances which give it this
      aspect. 1. The number of bones. 2. Their confused position. 3. Their being in different
      strata. 4. The strata in one part having no correspondence with those in another.
      5. The different states of decay in these strata, which seem to indicate a difference
      in the time of inhumation. 6. The existence of infant bones among them.

   <p id="xw20aab3d932">But on whatever occasion they may have been made, they are of considerable notoriety
      among the Indians: for a party passing, about thirty years ago, through the part of
      the country where this barrow is, went through the woods directly to it, without any
      instructions or enquiry, and having staid about it some time, with expressions which
      were construed to be those of sorrow, they returned to the high road, which they had
      <span id="page-162" class="pagenum">[ 162 ]</span> left about half a dozen miles to pay this visit, and pursued their journey. There
      is another barrow, much resembling this in the low grounds of the South branch of
      Shenandoah, where it is crossed by the road leading from the Rock-fish gap to Staunton.
      Both of these have, within these dozen years, been cleared of their trees and put
      under cultivation, are much reduced in their height, and spread in width, by the plough,
      and will probably disappear in time. There is another on a hill in the Blue ridge
      of mountains, a few miles North of Wood's gap, which is made up of small stones thrown
      together. This has been opened and found to contain human bones, as the others do.
      There are also many others in other parts of the country.

   <p id="xw20aab3d934">Great question has arisen from whence came those aboriginal inhabitants of America?
      Discoveries, long ago made, were sufficient to shew that a passage from Europe to
      America was always practicable, even to the imperfect navigation of ancient times.
      In going from Norway to Iceland, from Iceland to Groenland, from Groenland to Labrador,
      the first traject is the widest: and this having been practised from the earliest
      times of which we have any account of that part of the earth, it is not difficult
      to 
      <span id="page-t-i_21_page_1" class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 21, Page 1 ]</span>
      <p id="xw20aab3d934b6">In the Notes on Virgi. the great diversity of languages appearing 
         radically different which are spoken by the red men of America, is <del>considered as</del>
         supposed to authorize a supposition that <del>they have inhabited their country longer than</del> their 
         settlement is more remote than that of Asia by it's red inhabitants. but it
         must be confessed that the mind finds it difficult to concieve that so many tribes
         have inhabited it from so remote an antiquity as would be necessary to have divided <!--caret insertion: them-->
         them into language so radically different. I will therefore hazard a conjecture,
         as such, and only to be estimated at what it may be worth. we know that the Indians
         consider it as dishonorable to use any language but their own. hence in their councils
         with us, though some of them may have been in situations which from convenience or
         necessity have obliged them to learn our language well, yet they refuse to confer
         in it, &amp; always insist on the intervention of <!--caret insertion: an--> an interpreter, 
         tho he <!--caret insertion: may--> may understand 
         neither language so well as themselves: &amp; this fact is as general
         as our knowledge of the tribes of N. America. when therefore a fraction of a tribe

         they have quarreled, but to have one of their own. they have use but for
         few words, &amp; possess but few. it would require but a small effort of the mind to invent
         these and to acquire the habit of using them. perhaps this hypothesis presents less
         difficulty than that of so many radically distinct languages preserved by such handfuls
         of men, from an antiquity so remote that no data we possess will enable us to calculate
         it.

      discoveries of Captain Cook <i id="editorial-xw20aab3d934c12" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3d934c12" class="addEditorial">James Cook (1728-1779) was one of the most famous British navigators of the period.
         In his third voyage, from 1776 to 1779, he mapped the Pacific Coast of North America.</span>, coasting from Kamschatka to California, have proved that, if the two continents
      of Asia and America be separated at all, it is only by a narrow streight. So that
      from this side also, inhabitants may have passed into America: and the resemblance
      between the Indians of America and the Eastern inhabitants of Asia, would induce us
      to conjecture, that the former are the descendants of the latter, or the latter of
      the former: excepting indeed the Eskimaux, who, from the same circumstance of resemblance,
      and from identity of language, must be derived from the Groenlanders, and these probably
      from some of the northern parts of the old continent. A knowledge of their several
      languages would be the most certain evidence of their derivation which could be produced.
      In fact, it is the best proof of the affinity of nations which ever can be referred
      to. How many ages have elapsed since the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the Swiss,
      the Norwegians, Danes and Swedes have separated from their common stock? Yet how many
      more must elapse before the proofs of their common origin, which exist in their several
languages, will disappear? It is to be lamented then, very much to be lamented, <span id="page-164" class="pagenum">[ 164 ]</span>
 that we have suffered so many of the Indian tribes already to extinguish, without
      our having previously collected and deposited in the records of literature, the general
      rudiments at least of the languages they spoke. Were vocabularies formed of all the
      languages spoken in North and South America, preserving their appellations of the
      most common objects in nature, of those which must be present to every nation barbarous
      or civilised, with the inflections of their nouns and verbs, their principles of regimen
      and concord, and these deposited in all the public libraries, it would furnish opportunities
      to those skilled in the languages of the old world to compare them with these, now,
      or at any future time, and hence to construct the best evidence of the derivation
      of this part of the human race.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d936">But imperfect as is our knowledge of the tongues spoken in America, it suffices to
      discover the following remarkable fact. Arranging them under the radical ones to which
      they may be palpably traced, and doing the same by those of the red men of Asia, there
      will be found probably twenty in America, for one in Asia, of those radical languages,
      so called because, if they were ever the same, they have lost all resemblance to one
      another. A separation into dialects 
      <span id="page-t-i_22_page_1" class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 22, Page 1 ]</span>
      it will be seen that in several instances of these vocabularies there is a remarkable resemblance in the numbers when there
      is not a trace of it in the other parts of the languages. when a tribe has gone farther
      than it's neighbors in inventing a system of numeration, the obvious utility of this
      will occasion it to be immediately adopted by the surrounding tribes with only such
      modifications of the sound as may accommodate them to the habitual pronunciations
      of their own languages.
      <span id="page-165" class="pagenum">[ 165 ]</span> may be the work of a few ages only, but for two dialects to recede from one another
      till they have lost all vestiges of their common origin, must require an immense course
      of time; perhaps not less than many people give to the age of the earth. A greater
      number of those radical changes of language having taken place among the red men of
      America, proves them of greater antiquity than those of Asia.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d938">I will now proceed to state the nations and numbers of the Aborigines which still
      exist in a respectable and independant form. And as their undefined boundaries would
      render it difficult to specify those only which may be within any certain limits,
      and it may not be unacceptable to present a more general view of them, I will reduce
      within the form of a Catalogue all those within, and circumjacent to, the United States,
      whose names and numbers have come to my notice. These are taken from four different
      lists, the first of which was given in the year 1759 to General Stanwix by George
      Croglian, Deputy agent for Indian affairs under Sir William Johnson; the second was
      drawn up by a French trader of considerable note, resident among the Indians many
      years, and annexed to Colonel Bouquet's printed account of his expedition in 1764.
      The third was made <span id="page-166" class="pagenum">[ 166 ]</span> out by Captain Hutchins, who visited most of the tribes, by order, for the purpose
      of learning their numbers in 1768. And the fourth by John Dodge, an Indian trader,
      in 1779, except the numbers marked *, which are from other information.

   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d988">The counties have been enumerated under Query IX. They are 74 in number, of very unequal
      size and population. Of these 35 are on the tide waters, or in that parallel; 23 are
      in the Midlands, between the tide waters and Blue ridge of mountains; 8 between the
      Blue ridge and Alleghaney; and 8 westward of the Alleghaney.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d990">The state, by another division, is formed into parishes, many of which are commensurate
      with the counties: but sometimes a county comprehends more than one parish, and sometimes
      a parish more than one county. This division had relation to the religion of the state,
      a Parson of the Anglican church, with a fixed salary, having been heretofore established
      in each parish. The care of the poor was another object of the parochial division.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3d992">We have no townships. Our country being much intersected with navigable waters, and
      trade brought generally to our doors, instead of our being obliged to go in quest
      of it, has probably been one of the causes why we have no towns of any <span id="page-175" class="pagenum">[ 175 ]</span> consequence. Williamsburgh, which, till the year 1780, was the seat of our government,
      never contained above 1800 inhabitants; and Norfolk, the most populous town we ever
      had, contained but 6000. Our towns, but more properly our villages or hamlets, are

      <i>Norfolk</i> will probably be the emporium for all the trade of the Chesapeak bay and its
      waters; and a canal of 8 or or 10 miles will bring to it all that of Albermarle sound
      and its waters. Secondary to to this place, are the towns at the head of <span id="page-176" class="pagenum">[ 176 ]</span> the tidewaters, to wit, Petersburgh on Appamattox, Richmond on James river, Newcastle
      on York river, Alexandria on Patowmac, and Baltimore on the Patapsco. From these the
      distribution will be to subordinate situations in the country. Accidental circumstances
      however may controul the indications of nature, and in no instances do they do it
      more frequently than in the rise and fall of towns.

   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1012">Queen Elizabeth by her letters-patent, bearing date March 25, 1584, licensed Sir Walter
      Raleigh to search for remote heathen lands, not inhabited by Christian people, and
      granted to him, in fee simple, all the soil within 200 leagues of the places where
      his people should, within 6 years, make their dwellings or abidings; reserving only,
      to herself and her successors, their allegiance and one fifth part of all the gold
      and silver ore they should obtain. Sir Walter immediately sent out two ships which
      visited Wococon island <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1012b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1012b1" class="addEditorial">Better known now as Ocracoke Island, on the outer banks of North Carolina.</span> in North Carolina, and the <span id="page-177" class="pagenum">[ 177 ]</span> next year dispatched seven with 107 men, who settled in Roanoke island, about latitude
      35°. 50'. Here Okisko, king of the Weopomeiocs, in a full council of his people, is
      said to have acknowledged himself the homager of the Queen of England, and, after
      her, of Sir Walter Raleigh. A supply of 50 men were sent in 1586, and 150 in 1587.
      With these last, Sir Walter sent a Governor, appointed him twelve assistants, gave
      them a charter of incorporation, and instructed them to settle on Chesapeak bay. They
      landed however at Hatorask. In 1588, when a fleet was ready to sail with a new supply
      of colonists and necessaries, they were detained by the Queen to assist against the
      Spanish Armada. Sir Walter having now expended 40,000 l. in these enterprizes, obstructed
      occasionally by the crown, without a shilling of aid from it, was under a necessity
      of engaging others to adventure their money. He therefore, by deed bearing date the
      7th of March 1589, by the name of Sir Walter Raleigh, Chief Governor of Assamàcomòc,
      (probably Acomàc), alias Wingadacoia, alias Virginia, granted to Thomas Smith and
      others, in consideration of their adventuring certain sums of money, liberty of trade
      to his new country, free from all customs and taxes for seven <span id="page-178" class="pagenum">[ 178 ]</span> years, excepting the fifth part of the gold and silver ore to be obtained; and stipulated
      with them, and the other assistants, then in Virginia, that he would confirm the deed
      of incorporation which he had given in 1587, with all the prerogatives, jurisdictions,
      royalties and privileges granted to him by the Queen. Sir Walter, at different times,
      sent five other adventures hither, the last of which was in 1602: for in 1603 he was
      attainted, and put into close imprisonment, which put an end to his cares over his
      infant colony. What was the particular fate of the colonists he had before sent and
      seated, has never been known: whether they were murdered, or incorporated with the
      savages.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1014">Some gentlemen and merchants, supposing that by the attainder of Sir Walter Raleigh
      the grant to him was forfeited, not enquiring over carefully whether the sentence
      of an English court could affect lands not within the jurisdiction of that court,
      petitioned king James for a new grant of Virginia to them. He accordingly executed
      a grant to Sir Thomas Gates and others, bearing date the 9th of March 1607, under
      which, in the same year a settlement was effected at James-town and ever after maintained.
      Of this grant however no <span id="page-179" class="pagenum">[ 179 ]</span> particular notice need be taken, as it was superseded by letters-patent of the same
      king, of May 23, 1609, to the Earl of Salisbury and others, incorporating them by
      the name of 'the Treasurer and Company of adventurers and planters of the City of
      London for the first colony in Virginia,' granting to them and their successors all
      the lands in Virginia from Point Comfort along the sea coast to the northward 200
      miles, and from the same point along the sea coast to the southward 200 miles, and
      all the space from this precinct on the sea coast up into the land, West and North-west,
      from sea to sea, and the islands within one hundred miles of it, with all the commodities,
      jurisdictions, royalties, privileges, franchises and pre-eminences within the same,
      and thereto and thereabouts, by sea and land, appertaining, in as ample manner as
      had before been granted to any adventurer: to be held of the king and his successors,
      in common soccage, yielding one fifth part of the gold and silver ore to be therein
      found, for all manner of services; establishing a council in England for the direction
      of the enterprise, the members of which were to be chosen and displaced by the voice
      of the majority of the company and adventurers, and were to have the nomination and
      revocation of 
      <span id="page-180" class="pagenum">[ 180 ]</span> governors, officers, and ministers, which by them should be thought needful for the
      colony, the power of establishing laws and forms of government and magistracy, obligatory
      not only within the colony, but also on the seas in going and coming to and from it;
      authorising them to carry thither any persons who should consent to go, freeing them
      for ever from all taxes and impositions on any goods or merchandize on importation
      into the colony, or exportation out of it, except the five per cent, due for custom
      on all goods imported into the British dominions, according to the ancient trade of
      merchants; which five per cent, only being paid, they might, within 13 months, re-export
      the same goods into foreign parts, without any custom, tax, or other duty, to the
      king or any his officers or deputies: with powers of waging war against those who
      should annoy them: giving to the inhabitants of the colony all the rights of natural
      subjects, as if born and abiding in England; and declaring that these letters should
      be construed, in all doubtful parts, in such manner as should be most for the benefit
      of the grantees.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1016">Afterwards, on the 12th of March 1612, by other letters-patent, the king added to
      his former grants, all islands in any part of the ocean between the 30th and 41st
      degrees of 
      <span id="page-181" class="pagenum">[ 181 ]</span> latitude, and within 300 leagues of any of the parts before granted to the Treasurer
      and company, not being possessed or inhabited by any other christian prince or state,
      nor within the limits of the northern colony.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1018">In pursuance of the authorities given to the company by these charters, and more especially
      of that part in the charter of 1609, which authorised them to establish a form of
      government, they on the 24th of July 1621, by charter under their common seal, declared
      that from thenceforward there should be two supreme councils in Virginia, the one
      to be called the council of state, to be placed and displaced by the treasurer, council
      in England, and company, from time to time, whose office was to be that of assisting
      and advising the governor; the other to be called the general assembly, to be convened
      by the governor once yearly or oftener, which was to consist of the council of state,
      and two burgesses out of every town, hundred, or plantation, to be respectively chosen
      by the inhabitants. In this all matters were to be decided by the greater part of
      the votes present; reserving to the governor a negative voice; and they were to have
      power to treat, consult, and conclude all emergent occasions concerning the public
      weal, and to make laws for the behoof and 
      <span id="page-182" class="pagenum">[ 182 ]</span> government of the colony, imitating and following the laws and policy of England
      as nearly as might be: providing that these laws should have no force till ratified
      in a general quarter court of the company in England, and returned under their common
      seal, and declaring that, after the government of the colony should be well framed
      and settled, no orders of the council in England should bind the colony unless ratified
      in the said general assembly. The king and company quarrelled, and, by a mixture of
      law and force, the latter were ousted of all their rights, without retribution, after
      having expended 100,000 l. in establishing the colony, without the smallest aid from
      government. King James suspended their powers by proclamation of July 15, 1624, and
      Charles I. took the government into his own hands. Both sides had their partisans
      in the colony: but in truth the people of the colony in general thought themselves
      little concerned in the dispute. There being three parties interested in these several
      charters, what passed between the first and second it was thought could not affect
      the third. If the king seized on the powers of the company, they only passed into
      other hands, without increase or diminution, while the rights of the people remained
      as they were. But they did not 
      <span id="page-183" class="pagenum">[ 183 ]</span> remain so long. The northern parts of their country were granted away to the Lords
      Baltimore and Fairfax, the first of these obtaining also the rights of separate jurisdiction
      and government. And in 1650 the parliament, considering itself as standing in the
      place of their deposed king, and as having succeeded to all his powers, without as
      well as within the realm, began to assume a right over the colonies, passing an act
      for inhibiting their trade with foreign nations. This succession to the exercise of
      the kingly authority gave the first colour for parliamentary interference with the
      colonies, and produced that fatal precedent which they continued to follow after they
      had retired, in other respects, within, their proper functions. When this colony,
      therefore, which still maintained its opposition to Cromwell <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1018b5" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1018b5" class="addEditorial">Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) ruled as Lord Protector of England from 1653 until 1658.</span> and the parliament, was induced in 1651 to lay down their arms, they previously secured
      their most essential rights, by a solemn convention, which having never seen in print,
      I will here insert literally from the records.

      kings and parliaments, and other infractions of their constitution, equally dangerous,
      committed. Their General Assembly, which was composed of the council of state and
      burgesses, sitting together and deciding by plurality of voices, was split into two
      houses, by which the council obtained a separate negative on their laws. Appeals from
      their supreme court, which had been fixed by law in their General Assembly, were arbitrarily
      revoked to England, to be there heard before the king and council. Instead of four
      hundred miles on the sea coast, they

      <span id="page-190" class="pagenum">[ 190 ]</span> were reduced, in the space of thirty years, to about one hundred miles. Their trade
      with foreigners was totally suppressed, and, when carried to Great-Britain, was there
      loaded with imposts. It is unnecessary, however, to glean up the several instances
      of injury, as scattered through American and British history, and the more especially
      as, by passing on to the accession of the present king, we shall find specimens of
      them all, aggravated, multiplied and crouded within a small compass of time, so as
      to evince a fixed design of considering our rights natural, conventional and chartered
      as mere nullities. The following is an epitome of the first fifteen years of his reign.
      The colonies were taxed internally and externally; their essential interests sacrificed
      to individuals in Great-Britain; their legislatures suspended; charters annulled;
      trials by juries taken away; their persons subjected to transportation across the
      Atlantic, and to trial before foreign judicatories; their supplications for redress
      thought beneath answer; themselves published as cowards in the councils of their mother
      country and courts of Europe; armed troops sent among them to enforce submission to
      these violences; and actual hostilities commenced against them. No alternative was
      presented but resistance, or <span id="page-191" class="pagenum">[ 191 ]</span> unconditional submission. Between these could be no hesitation. They closed in the
      appeal to arms. They declared themselves independent States. They confederated together
      into one great republic; thus securing to every state the benefit of an union of their
      whole force. In each state separately a new form of government was established. Of
      ours particularly the following are the outlines. The executive powers are lodged
      in the hands of a governor, chosen annually, and incapable of acting more than three
      years in seven. He is assisted by a council of eight members. The judiciary powers
      are divided among several courts, as will be hereafter explained. Legislation is exercised
      by two houses of assembly, the one called the house of Delegates, composed of two
      members from each county, chosen annually by the citizens possessing an estate for
      life in 100 acres of uninhabited land, or 25 acres with a house on it, or in a house
      or lot in some town: the other called the Senate consisting of 24 members, chosen
      quadrennially by the same electors, who for this purpose are distributed into 24 districts.
      The concurrence of both houses is necessary to the passage of a law. They have the
      appointment of the governor and council, the judges of the superior courts, auditors,
      <span id="page-192" class="pagenum">[ 192 ]</span> attorney-general, treasurer, register of the land office, and delegates to congress.
      As the dismemberment of the state had never had its confirmation, but, on the contrary,
      had always been the subject of protestation and complaint, that it might never be
      in our own power to raise scruples on that subject, or to disturb the harmony of our
      new confederacy, the grants to Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the two Carolinas, were
      ratified.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1072">This constitution was formed when we were new and unexperienced in the science of
      government. It was the first too which was formed in the whole United States. No wonder
      then that time and trial have discovered very capital defects in it.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1074">1. The majority of the men in the state, who pay and fight for its support, are unrepresented
      in the legislature, the roll of freeholders intitled to vote, not including generally
      the half of those on the roll of the militia, or of the tax-gatherers.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1076">2. Among those who share the representation, the shares are very unequal. Thus the
      county of Warwick, with only one hundred fighting men, has an equal representation
      with the county of Loudon, which has 1746. So that every man in Warwick has as much
      influence in the government as 17 men in Loudon. But lest it should be thought that
      <span id="page-193" class="pagenum">[ 193 ]</span> an equal interspersion of small among large counties, through the whole state, may
      prevent any danger of injury to particular parts of it, we will divide it into districts,
      and shew the proportions of land, of fighting men, and of representation in each.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1080">An inspection of this table will supply the place of commentaries on it. It will appear
      at once that nineteen thousand men, living below the falls of the rivers, possess
      half the senate, and want four members only of possessing a majority of the house
      of delegates; a want more than supplied by the vicinity of their situation to the
      seat of government, and of course the greater degree of convenience and punctuality
      with which their members may and will attend in the legislature. These nineteen thousand,
      therefore, living in one part of the country, give 
      <span id="xw20aab3e1080b1" class="authorNote">* Of these, 542 are on the Eastern shore.</span>

      officers executive and judiciary. From the difference of their situation and circumstances,
      their interests will often be very different.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1082">3. The senate is, by its constitution, too homogeneous with the house of delegates.
      Being chosen by the same electors, at the same time, and out of the same subjects,
      the choice falls of course on men of the same description. The purpose of establishing
      different houses of legislation is to introduce the influence of different interests
      or different principles. Thus in Great-Britain it is said their constitution relies
      on the house of commons for honesty, and the lords for wisdom; which would be a rational
      reliance if honesty were to be bought with money, and if wisdom were hereditary. In
      some of the American states the delegates and senators are so chosen, as that the
      first represent the persons, and the second the property of the state. But with us,
      wealth and wisdom have equal chance for admission into both houses. We do not therefore
      derive from the separation of our legislature into two houses, those benefits which
      a proper complication of principles is capable of producing, and those which alone
      can compensate the evils which may be produced by their dissensions.

   <p><span id="page-195" class="pagenum">[ 195 ]</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1090">4. All the powers of government, legislative, executive, and judiciary, result to
      the legislative body. The concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition
      of despotic government. It will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised
      by a plurality of hands, and not by a single one. 173 despots would surely be as oppressive
      as one. Let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of Venice. As little
      will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves; An <i id="xw20aab3e1090b1">elective despotism</i> was not the government we fought for; but one which should not only be founded on
      free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced
      among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits,
      without being effectually checked and restrained by the others. For this reason that
      convention, which passed the ordinance of government, laid its foundation on this
      basis, that the legislative, executive and judiciary departments should be separate
      and distinct, so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them
      at the same time. But no barrier was provided between these several powers. The judiciary
      and executive members were left dependant on the legislative, for their subsistence
      in office, and some of them for their <span id="page-196" class="pagenum">[ 196 ]</span> continuance in it. If therefore the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers,
      no opposition is likely to be made; nor, if made, can it be effectual; because in
      that case they may put their proceedings into the form of an act of assembly, which
      will render them obligatory on the other branches. They have accordingly, in many
      instances, decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy: and
      the direction of the executive, during the whole time of their session, is becoming
      habitual and familiar. And this is done with no ill intention. The views of the present
      members are perfectly upright. When they are led out of their regular province, it
      is by art in others, and inadvertence in themselves. And this will probably be the
      case for some time to come. But it will not be a very long time. Mankind soon learn
      to make interested uses of every right and power which they possess, or may assume.
      The public money and public liberty, intended to have been deposited with three branches
      of magistracy, but found inadvertently to be in the hands of one only, will soon be
      discovered to be sources of wealth and dominion to those who hold them; distinguished
      too by this tempting circumstance, that they are the instrument, as well as the object
      of acquisition. With <span id="page-197" class="pagenum">[ 197 ]</span> money we will get men, said Cæsar, and with men we will get money. Nor should our
      assembly be deluded by the integrity of their own purposes, and conclude that these
      unlimited powers will never be abused, because themselves are not disposed to abuse
      them. They should look forward to a time, and that not a distant one, when corruption
      in this, as in the country from which we derive our origin, will have seized the heads
      of government, and be spread by them through the body of the people; when they will
      purchase the voices of the people, and make them pay the price. Human nature is the
      same on every side of the Atlantic, and will be alike influenced by the same causes.
      The time to guard against corruption and tyranny, is before they shall have gotten
      hold on us. It is better to keep the wolf out of the fold, than to trust to drawing
      his teeth and talons after he shall have entered. To render these considerations the
      more cogent, we must observe in addition, 
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1092">5. That the ordinary legislature may alter the constitution itself. On the discontinuance
      of assemblies, it became necessary to substitute in their place some other body, competent
      to the ordinary business of government, and to the calling forth the powers of the
      state for the maintenance of our 
      <span id="page-198" class="pagenum">[ 198 ]</span> opposition to Great-Britain. Conventions were therefore introduced, consisting of
      two delegates from each county, meeting together and forming one house, on the plan
      of the former house of Burgesses, to whose places they succeeded. These were at first
      chosen anew for every particular session. But in March 1775, they recommended to the
      people to chuse a convention, which should continue in office a year. This was done
      accordingly in April 1775, and in the July following that convention passed an ordinance
      for the election of delegates in the month of April annually. It is well known, that
      in July 1775, a separation from Great-Britain and establishment of Republican government
      had never yet entered into any person's mind. A convention therefore, chosen under
      that ordinance, cannot be said to have been chosen for purposes which certainly did
      not exist in the minds of those who passed it. Under this ordinance, at the annual
      election in April 1776, a convention for the year was chosen. Independance, and the
      establishment of a new form of government, were not even yet the objects of the people
      at large. One extract from the pamphlet called Common Sense had appeared in the Virginia
      papers in February, and copies of the pamphlet itself had got into a few hands. But
      the idea 
      <span id="page-199" class="pagenum">[ 199 ]</span> had not been opened to the mass of the people in April, much less can it be said
      that they had made up their minds in its favor. So that the electors of April 1776,
      no more than the legislators of July 1775, not thinking of independance and a permanent
      republic, could not mean to vest in these delegates powers of establishing them, or
      any authorities other than those of the ordinary legislature. So far as a temporary
      organization of government was necessary to render our opposition energetic, so far
      their organization was valid. But they received in their creation no powers but what
      were given to every legislature before and since. They could not therefore pass an
      act transcendant to the powers of other legislatures. If the present assembly pass
      any act, and declare it shall be irrevocable by subsequent assemblies, the declaration
      is merely void, and the act repealable, as other acts are. So far, and no farther
      authorized, they organized the government by the ordinance entitled a Constitution
      or Form of government. It pretends to no higher authority than the other ordinances
      of the same session; it does not say, that it shall be perpetual; that it shall be
      unalterable by other legislatures; that it shall be transcendant above the powers
      of those, who they knew would have equal power with themselves. Not only the silence
      of 
      <span id="page-200" class="pagenum">[ 200 ]</span> the instrument is a proof they thought it would be alterable, but their own practice
      also: for this very convention, meeting as a House of Delegates in General Assembly
      with the new Senate in the autumn of that year, passed acts of assembly in contradiction
      to their ordinance of government; and every assembly from that time to this has done
      the same. I am safe therefore in the position, that the constitution itself is alterable
      by the ordinary legislature. Though this opinion seems founded on the first elements
      of common sense, yet is the contrary maintained by some persons. 1. Because, say they,
      the conventions were vested with every power necessary to make effectual opposition
      to Great-Britain. But to complete this argument, they must go on, and say further,
      that effectual opposition could not be made to Great-Britain, without establishing
      a form of government perpetual and unalterable by the legislature; which is not true.
      An opposition which at some time or other was to come to an end, could not need a
      perpetual institution to carry it on: and a government, amendable as its defects should
      be discovered, was as likely to make effectual resistance, as one which should be
      unalterably wrong. Besides, the assemblies were as much vested with all powers requisite
      for resistance 
      <span id="page-201" class="pagenum">[ 201 ]</span> as the conventions were. If therefore these powers included that of modelling the
      form of government in the one case, they did so in the other. The assemblies then
      as well as the conventions may model the government; that is, they may alter the ordinance
      of government. 2. They urge, that if the convention had meant that this instrument
      should be alterable, as their other ordinances were, they would have called it an
      ordinance: but they have called it a <i id="xw20aab3e1092b9">constitution</i>, which ex vi termini means 'an act above the power of the ordinary legislature.'
      I answer, that <i id="xw20aab3e1092c11">constitutio, constitutum, statutum, lex</i>, are convertible terms. '<i id="xw20aab3e1092c13">Constitutio</i> dicitur jus quod a principe conditur.' '<i id="xw20aab3e1092c15">Constitutum</i>, quod ab imperatoribus rescriptum statutumve est.' '<i id="xw20aab3e1092c17">Statutum</i>, idem quod lex.'

The term <i id="xw20aab3e1092c27">constitution</i> has many other significations in physics and in politics; but in Jurisprudence, whenever
      it is applied to any act of the legislature, it 
      <span id="xw20aab3e1092c29" class="authorNote">* To <i id="xw20aab3e1092c29b1">bid</i>, to <i id="xw20aab3e1092c29b3">set</i>, was the antient legislative word of the English. Ll. Hlotharii &amp; Eadrici. Ll. Inæ.

      <span id="page-202" class="pagenum">[ 202 ]</span> invariably means a statute, law, or ordinance, which is the present case. No inference
      then of a different meaning can be drawn from the adoption of this title: on the contrary,
      we might conclude, that, by their affixing to it a term synonimous with ordinance,
      or statute, they meant it to be an ordinance or statute. But of what consequence is
      their meaning, where their power is denied? If they meant to do more than they had
      power to do, did this give them power? It is not the name, but the authority which
      renders an act obligatory.

      have attempted to restrain subsequent parliaments yet could they never effect it;
      for the latter parliament hath ever power to abrogate, suspend, qualify, explain,
      or make void the former in the whole or in any part thereof, notwithstanding any words
      of restraint, prohibition, or penalty, in the former: for it is a maxim in the laws
      of the parliament, quod leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant.' 4. inst. 43.&#8212;To
      get rid of the magic supposed to be in 
      <span id="page-203" class="pagenum">[ 203 ]</span> the word <i id="xw20aab3e1092c37">constitution</i>, let us translate it into its definition as given by those who think it above the
      power of the law; and let us suppose the convention instead of saying, 'We, the ordinary
      legislature, establish a <i id="xw20aab3e1092c39">constitution</i>,' had said, 'We, the ordinary legislature, establish an act <i id="xw20aab3e1092c41">above the power of the ordinary legislature</i>.' Does not this expose the absurdity of the attempt? 3. But, say they, the people
      have acquiesced, and this has given it an authority superior to the laws. It is true
      that the people did not rebel against it: and was that a time for the people to rise
      in rebellion? Should a prudent acquiescence, at a critical time, be construed into
      a confirmation of every illegal thing done during that period? Besides, why should
      they rebel? At an annual election, they had chosen delegates for the year, to exercise
      the ordinary powers of legislation, and to manage the great contest in which they
      were engaged. These delegates thought the contest would be best managed by an organized
      government. They therefore, among others, passed an ordinance of government. They
      did not presume to call it perpetual and unalterable. They well knew they had no power
      to make it so; that our choices of them had been for no such purpose, and at a time
      when we could have no such purpose in contemplation. Had an 
      <span id="page-204" class="pagenum">[ 204 ]</span> unalterable form of government been meditated, perhaps we should have chosen a different
      set of people. There was no cause then for the people to rise in rebellion. But to
      what dangerous lengths will this argument lead? Did the acquiescence of the colonies
      under the various acts of power exercised by Great-Britain in our infant state, confirm
      these acts, and so far invest them with the authority of the people as to render them
      unalterable, and our present resistance wrong? On every unauthoritative exercise of
      power by the legislature, must the people rise in rebellion, or their silence be construed
      into a surrender of that power to them? If so, how many rebellions should we have
      had already? One certainly for every session of assembly. The other states in the
      Union have been of opinion, that to render a form of government unalterable by ordinary
      acts of assembly, the people must delegate persons with special powers. They have
      accordingly chosen special conventions to form and fix their governments. The individuals
      then who maintain the contrary opinion in this country, should have the modesty to
      suppose it possible that they may be wrong and the rest of America right. But if there
      be only a possibility of their being wrong, if only a plausible doubt remains of the
      validity of 
      <span id="page-205" class="pagenum">[ 205 ]</span> the ordinance of government, is it not better to remove that doubt, by placing it
      on a bottom which none will dispute? If they be right, we shall only have the unnecessary
      trouble of meeting once in convention. If they be wrong, they expose us to the hazard
      of having no fundamental rights at all. True it is, this is no time for deliberating
      on forms of government. While an enemy is within our bowels, the first object is to
      expel him. But when this shall be done, when peace shall be established, and leisure
      given us for intrenching within good forms, the rights for which we have bled, let
      no man be found indolent enough to decline a little more trouble for placing them
      beyond the reach of question. If any thing more be requisite to produce a conviction
      of the expediency of calling a convention, at a proper season, to fix our form of
      government, let it be the reflection,

      They continued for some time to require the presence of a majority of their whole
      number, to pass an act. But the British parliament fixes its own quorum: our former
      assemblies fixed their own quorum: and one precedent in favour of power is stronger
      than an hundred against it. The house of delegates therefore have &#8225; lately voted that,
      during the present dangerous invasion, forty members shall be a house to proceed to
      business. They have been moved to this by the fear of not being able to collect a
      house. But this danger could not authorize them to call that a house which was none:
      and if they may fix it at one number, they may at another, till it loses its fundamental
      character of being a representative body. As this vote expires with the present invasion,
      it is probable the former rule will be permitted to revive: because at present no
      ill is meant. The power however of fixing their own quorum has been avowed, and a
      precedent set. From forty it may be reduced to four, and from four to one: from a
      house to a committee, from a committee to a chairman or speaker, and thus an oligarchy

      new constitution, expressed or implied? Every lineament of that expressed or implied,
      is in full opposition to it. Its fundamental principle is, that the state shall be
      governed as a commonwealth. It provides a republican organization, proscribes under
      the name of <i>prerogative</i> the exercise of all powers undefined by the laws; places on
      this basis the 
<span id="page-209" class="pagenum">[ 209 ]</span>
 whole system of our laws; and, by consolidating them together, chuses that they shall
      be left to stand or fall together, never providing for any circumstances, nor admitting
      that such could arise, wherein either should be suspended, no, not for a moment. Our
      antient laws expressly declare, that those who are but delegates themselves shall
      not delegate to others powers which require judgment and integrity in their exercise.&#8212;
      Or was this proposition moved on a supposed right in the movers of abandoning their
      posts in a moment of distress? The same laws forbid the abandonment of that post,
      even on ordinary occasions; and much more a transfer of their powers into other hands
      and other forms, without consulting the people. They never admit the idea that these,
      like sheep or cattle, may be given from hand to hand without an appeal to their own
      will.&#8212; Was it from the necessity of the case? Necessities which dissolve a government,
      do not convey its authority to an oligarchy or a monarchy. They throw back, into the
      hands of the people, the powers they had delegated, and leave them as individuals
      to shift for themselves. A leader may offer, but not impose himself, nor be imposed
      on them. Much less can their necks be submitted to his sword, their breath be held
      at 
      <span id="page-210" class="pagenum">[ 210 ]</span> his will or caprice. The necessity which should operate these tremendous effects
      should at least be palpable and irresistible. Yet in both instances, where it was
      feared, or pretended with us, it was belied by the event. It was belied too by the
      preceding experience of our sister states, several of whom had grappled through greater
      difficulties without abandoning their forms of government. When the proposition was
      first made, Massachusetts had found even the government of committees sufficient to
      carry them through an invasion. But we at the time of that proposition were under
      no invasion. When the second was made, there had been added to this example those
      of Rhode-Island, New-York, New-Jersey, and Pennsylvania, in all of which the republican
      form had been found equal to the task of carrying them through the severest trials.
      In this state alone did there exist so little virtue, that fear was to be fixed in
      the hearts of the people, and to become the motive of their exertions and the principle
      of their government? The very thought alone was treason against the people; was treason
      against mankind in general; as rivetting for ever the chains which bow down their
      necks, by giving to their oppressors a proof, which they would have trumpeted through
      the <span id="page-211" class="pagenum">[ 211 ]</span> universe, of the imbecility of republican government in times of pressing danger,
      to shield them from harm. Those who assume the right of giving away the reins of government
      in any case, must be sure that the herd, whom they hand on to the rods and hatchet
      of the dictator, will lay their necks on the block when he shall nod to them. But
      if our assemblies supposed such a resignation in the people, I hope they mistook their
      character. I am of opinion, that the government, instead of being braced and invigorated
      for greater exertions under their difficulties, would have been thrown back upon the
      bungling machinery of county committees for administration, till a convention could
      have been called, and its wheels again set into regular motion. What a cruel moment
      was this for creating such an embarrassment, for putting to the proof the attachment
      of our countrymen to republican government! Those who meant well, of the advocates
      for this measure, (and most of them meant well, for I know them personally, had been
      their fellow labourers in the common cause, and had often proved the purity of their
      principles), had been seduced in their judgment by the example of an ancient republic,
      whose constitution and circumstances were fundamentally different. <span id="page-212" class="pagenum">[ 212 ]</span> They had sought this precedent in the history of Rome, where alone it was to be found,
      and where at length too it had proved fatal. They had taken it from a republic, rent
      by the most bitter factions and tumults, where the government was of a heavy-handed
      unfeeling aristocracy, over a people ferocious, and rendered desperate by poverty
      and wretchedness; tumults which could not be allayed under the most trying circumstances,
      but by the omnipotent hand of a single despot. Their constitution therefore allowed
      a temporary tyrant to be erected, under the name of a Dictator; and that temporary
      tyrant, after a few examples, became perpetual. They misapplied this precedent to
      a people, mild in their dispositions, patient under their trial, united for the public
      liberty, and affectionate to their leaders. But if from the constitution of the Roman
      government there resulted to their Senate a power of submitting all their rights to
      the will of one man, does it follow, that the assembly of Virginia have the same authority?
      What clause in our constitution has substituted that of Rome, by way of residuary
      provision, for all cases not otherwise provided for? Or if they may step ad libitum
into any other form of government for precedents to rule us by, for what <span id="page-213" class="pagenum">[ 213 ]</span>
 oppression may not a precedent be found in this world of the bellum omnium in omnia?

      a colour of right or reason, but the defect before developed, that there being no
      barrier between the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments, the legislature
      may seize the whole: that having seized it, and possessing a right to fix their own
      quorum, they may reduce that quorum to one, whom they may call a chairman, speaker,
      dictator, or by any other name they please.&#8212; Our situation is indeed perilous, and
      I hope my countrymen will be sensible of it, and will apply, at a proper season, the
      proper remedy; which is a convention to fix the constitution, to amend its defects,
      to bind up the several branches of government bv certain laws, which when they transgress
      their acts shall become nullities; to render unnecessary an appeal to the people,
      or in other words a rebellion, on every infraction of their rights, on the peril that
      their acquiescence shall be construed into an intention to surrender those rights.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1104">THE administration of justice and description of the laws?
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1106">The state is divided into counties. In every county are appointed magistrates, called
      justices of the peace, usually from eight to thirty or forty in number, in proportion
      to the size of the county, of the most discreet and honest inhabitants. They are nominated
      by their fellows, but commissioned by the governor, and act without reward. These
      magistrates have jurisdiction both criminal and civil. If the question before them
      be a question of law only, they decide on it themselves: but if it be of fact, or
      of fact and law combined, it must be referred to a jury. In the latter case, of a
      combination of law and fact, it is usual for the jurors to decide the fact, and to
      refer the law arising on it to the decision of the judges. But this division of the
      subject lies with their discretion only. And if the question relate to any point of
      public liberty, or if it be one of those in which the judges may be suspected of bias,
      the jury undertake to decide both law and fact. If they be mistaken, a decision against
      right, which is casual only, is less dangerous to the state, <span id="page-215" class="pagenum">[ 215 ]</span> and less afflicting to the loser, than one which makes part of a regular and uniform
      system. In truth, it is better to toss up cross and pile in a cause, than to refer
      it to a judge whose mind is warped by any motives whatever, in that particular case.
      But the common sense of twelve honest men gives still a better chance of just decision,
      than the hazard of cross and pile. These judges execute their process by the sheriff
      or coroner of the county, or by constables of their own appointment. If any free person
      commit an offence against the commonwealth, if it be below the degree of felony, he
      is bound by a justice to appear before their court, to answer it on indictment or
      information. If it amount to felony, he is committed to jail, a court of these justices
      is called; if they on examination think him guilty, they send him to the jail of the
      general court, before which court, he is to be tried first by a grand jury of 24,
      of whom 13 must concur in opinion: if they find him guilty, he is then tried by a
      jury of 12 men of the county where the offence was committed, and by their verdict,
      which must be unanimous, he is acquitted or condemned without appeal. If the criminal
      be a slave the trial by the county court is final. In every case however, except that
      of high treason, there resides in the governor a <span id="page-216" class="pagenum">[ 216 ]</span> power of pardon. In high treason, the pardon can only flow from the general assembly.
      In civil matters these justices have jurisdiction in all cases of whatever value,
      not appertaining to the department of the admiralty. This jurisdiction is twofold.
      If the matter in dispute be of less value than 4 1/6 dollars, a single member may try it at any time and place within his county, and
      may award execution on the goods of the party cast.  If it be of that or greater value,
      it is determinable before the county court, which consists of four at the least of
      those justices, and assembles at the court-house of the county on a certain day in
      every month. From their determination, if the matter be of the value of ten pounds
      sterling, or concern the title or bounds of lands, an appeal lies to one of the superior
      courts.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1108">There are three superior courts, to wit, the high-court of chancery, the general court,
      and court of admiralty. The first and second of these receive appeals from the county
      courts, and also have original jurisdiction where the subject of controversy is of
      the value of ten pounds sterling, or where it concerns the title or bounds of land.
      The jurisdiction of the admiralty is original altogether. The high-court of chancery
      is composed of three judges, the general court <span id="page-217" class="pagenum">[ 217 ]</span> of five, and the court of admiralty of three. The two first hold their sessions at
      Richmond at stated times, the chancery twice in the year, and the general court twice
      for business civil and criminal, and twice more for criminal only. The court of admiralty
      sits at Williamsburgh whenever a controversy arises.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1110">There is one supreme court, called the court of appeals, composed of the judges of
      the three superior courts, assembling twice a year at stated times at Richmond. This
      court receives appeals in all civil cases from each of the superior courts, and determines
      them finally. But it has no original jurisdiction.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1112">If a controversy arise between two foreigners of a nation in alliance with the United
      States, it is decided by the Consul for their State, or, if both parties chuse it,
      by the ordinary courts of justice. If one of the parties only be such a foreigner,
      it is triable before the courts of justice of the country. But if it shall have been
      instituted in a county court, the foreigner may remove it into the general court,
      or court of chancery, who are to determine it at their first sessions, as they must
      also do if it be originally commenced before them. In cases of life and death, such
      foreigners have a right to be <span id="page-218" class="pagenum">[ 218 ]</span> tried by a jury, the one half foreigners, the other natives.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1114">All public accounts are settled with a board of auditors, consisting of three members,
      appointed by the general assembly, any two of whom may act. But an individual, dissatisfied
      with the determination of that board, may carry his case into the proper superior
      court.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1116">A description of the laws. </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1118">The general assembly was constituted, as has been already shewn, by letters-patent
      of March the 9th, 1607, in the 4th year of the reign of James the First. The laws
      of England seem to have been adopted by consent of the settlers, which might easily
      enough be done whilst they were few and living all together. Of such adoption however
      we have no other proof than their practice, till the year 1661, when they were expressly
      adopted by an act of the assembly, except so far as 'a difference of condition rendered
      them inapplicable. Under this adoption, the rule, in our courts of judicature was,
      that the common law of England, and the general statutes previous to the 4th of James,
      were in force here; but that no subsequent statutes were, <i id="xw20aab3e1118b1">unless we were named in them</i>, said the judges and other partisans of the crown, but <i id="xw20aab3e1118b3">named or not named</i>, said those <span id="page-219" class="pagenum">[ 219 ]</span> who reflected freely. It will be unnecessary to attempt a description of the laws
      of England, as that may be found in English publications. To those which were established
      here, by the adoption of the legislature, have been since added a number of acts of
      assembly passed during the monarchy, and ordinances of convention and acts of assembly
      enacted since the establishment of the republic. The following variations from the
      British model are perhaps worthy of being specified.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1120">Debtors unable to pay their debts, and making faithful delivery of their whole effects,
      are released from confinement, and their persons for ever discharged from restraint
      for such previous debts: but any property they may afterwards acquire will be subject
      to their creditors.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1122">The poor, unable to support themselves, are maintained by an assessment on the titheable
      persons in their parish. This assessment is levied and administered by twelve persons
      in each parish, called vestrymen, originally chosen by the housekeepers of the parish,
      but afterwards filling vacancies in their own body by their own choice. These are
      usually the most discreet farmers, so distributed through their parish, that every
      part of it may be under the immediate eye of some one <span id="page-220" class="pagenum">[ 220 ]</span> of them. They are well acquainted with the details and &#339;conomy of private life, and
      they find sufficient inducements to execute their charge well, in their philanthropy,
      in the approbation of their neighbours, and the distinction which that gives them.
      The poor who have neither property, friends, nor strength to labour, are boarded in
      the houses of good farmers, to whom a stipulated sum is annually paid. To those who
      are able to help themselves a little, or have friends from whom they derive some succours,
      inadequate however to their full maintenance, supplementory aids are given, which
      enable them to live comfortably in their own houses, or in the houses of their friends.
      Vagabonds, without visible property or vocation, are placed in workhouses, where they
      are well cloathed, fed, lodged, and made to labour. Nearly the same method of providing
      for the poor prevails through all our states; and from Savannah to Portsmouth you
      will seldom meet a beggar. In the larger towns indeed they sometimes present themselves.
      These are usually foreigners, who have never obtained a settlement in any parish.
      I never yet saw a native American begging in the streets or highways. A subsistence
      is easily gained here: and if, by misfortunes, they are thrown on the charities of
      the world, <span id="page-221" class="pagenum">[ 221 ]</span> those provided by their own country are so comfortable and so certain, that they
      never think of relinquishing them to become strolling beggars. Their situation too,
      when sick, in the family of a good farmer, where every member is emulous to do them
      kind offices, where they are visited by all the neighbours, who bring them the little
      rarities which their sickly appetites may crave, and who take by rotation the nightly
      watch over them, when their condition requires it, is without comparison better than
      in a general hospital, where the sick, the dying, and the dead are crammed together,
      in the same rooms, and often in the same beds. The disadvantages, inseparable from
      general hospitals, are such as can never be counterpoised by all the regularities
      of medicine and regimen. Nature and kind nursing save a much greater proportion in
      our plain way, at a smaller expence, and with less abuse. One branch only of hospital
      institution is wanting with us; that is, a general establishment for those labouring
      under difficult cases of chirurgery <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1122b5" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1122b5" class="addEditorial">Surgery</span>. The aids of this art are not equivocal. But an able chirurgeon cannot be had in
      every parish. Such a receptacle should therefore be provided for those patients; but
      no others should be admitted.
   </p> 
   <p><span id="page-222" class="pagenum">[ 222 ]</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1130">Marriages must be solemnized either on special licence, granted by the first magistrate
      of the county, on proof of the consent of the parent or guardian of either party under
      age, or after solemn publication, on three several Sundays, at some place of religious
      worship, in the parishes where the parties reside. The act of solemnization may be
      by the minister of any society of Christians, who shall have been previously licensed
      for this purpose by the court of the county. Quakers and Menonists however are exempted
      from all these conditions, and marriage among them is to be solemnized by the society
      itself.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1132">A foreigner of any nation, not in open war with us, becomes naturalized by removing
      to the state to reside, and taking an oath of fidelity: and thereupon acquires every
      right of a native citizen: and citizens may divest themselves of that character, by
      declaring, by solemn deed, or in open court, that they mean to expatriate themselves,
      and no longer to be citizens of this state.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1134">Conveyances of land must be registered in the court of the county wherein they lie,
      or in the general court, or they are void, as to creditors, and subsequent purchasers.</p>
   <p>Slaves pass by descent and dower as lands do. Where the descent is from a parent,
      the heir is bound to pay an equal share of their <span id="page-223" class="pagenum">[ 223 ]</span> value in money to each of his brothers and sisters.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1136">Slaves, as well as lands, were entailable during the monarchy: but, by an act of the
      first republican assembly, all donees in tail, present and future, were vested with
      the absolute dominion of the entailed subject. 
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1138">Bills of exchange, being protested, carry 10 per cent. interest from their date.</p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1140">No person is allowed, in any other case, to take more than five per cent. per annum
      simple interest, for the loan of monies.
   </p> 
   <p id="xw20aab3e1142">Gaming debts are made void, and monies actually paid to discharge such debts (if they
      exceeded 40 shillings) may be recovered by the payer within three months, or by any
      other person afterwards.
   </p> 
   <p id="xw20aab3e1144">Tobacco, flour, beef, pork, tar, pitch, and turpentine, must be inspected by persons
      publicly appointed, before they can be exported.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1146">The erecting iron-works and mills is encouraged by many privileges; with necessary
      cautions however to prevent their dams from obstructing the navigation of the watercourses.
      The general assembly have on several occasions shewn a great desire to encourage the
      opening the great falls of James and Patowmac rivers. As yet, however, neither of
      these have been effected.
   </p>
   <p><span id="page-224" class="pagenum">[ 224 ]</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1150">The laws have also descended to the preservation and improvement of the races of useful
      animals, such as horses, cattle, deer; to the extirpation of those which are noxious,
      as wolves, squirrels, crows, blackbirds; and to the guarding our citizens against
      infectious disorders, by obliging suspected vessels coming into the state, to perform
      quarantine, and by regulating the conduct of persons having such disorders within
      the state.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1152">The mode of acquiring lands, in the earliest times of our settlement, was by petition
      to the general assembly. If the lands prayed for were already cleared of the Indian
      title, and the assembly thought the prayer reasonable, they passed the property by
      their vote to the petitioner. But if they had not yet been ceded by the Indians, it
      was necessary that the petitioner should previously purchase their right. This purchase
      the assembly verified, by enquiries of the Indian proprietors; and being satisfied
      of its reality and fairness, proceeded further to examine the reasonableness of the
      petition, and its consistence with policy; and, according to the result, either granted
      or rejected the petition. The company also sometimes, though very rarely, granted
      lands, independantly of the general assembly. As the colony increased, and individual
      applications for land <span id="page-225" class="pagenum">[ 225 ]</span> multiplied, it was found to give too much occupation to the general assembly to enquire
      into and execute the grant in every special case. They therefore thought it better
      to establish general rules, according to which all grants should be made, and to leave
      to the governor the execution of them, under these rules. This they did by what have
      been usually called the land laws, amending them from time to time, as their defects
      were developed. According to these laws, when an individual wished a portion of unappropriated
      land, he was to locate and survey it by a public officer, appointed for that purpose:
      its breadth was to bear a certain proportion to its length: the grant was to be executed
      by the governor: and the lands were to be improved in a certain manner, within a given
      time. From these regulations there resulted to the state a sole and exclusive power
      of taking conveyances of the Indian right of soil: since, according to them, an Indian
      conveyance alone could give no right to an individual, which the laws would acknowledge.
      The state, or the crown, thereafter, made general purchases of the Indians from time
      to time, and the governor parcelled them out by special grants, conformed to the rules
      before described, which it was not in his power, or in that of the <span id="page-226" class="pagenum">[ 226 ]</span> crown, to dispense with. Grants, unaccompanied by their proper legal circumstances,
      were set aside regularly by <i id="xw20aab3e1152b5">scire facias</i>, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1152b7" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1152b7" class="addEditorial">Latin for "let him/them know"; originating in medieval English law, this refers to
         a kind of writ that would require the receiver to demonstrate to a court why a certain
         action should not be taken. If the defendant fails to state an adequate case, the
         court could, as Jefferson describes here "set aside" their interest.</span> or by bill in Chancery. Since the establishment of our new government, this order
      of things is but little changed. An individual, wishing to appropriate to himself
      lands still unappropriated by any other, pays to the public treasurer a sum of money
      proportioned to the quantity he wants. He carries the treasurer's receipt to the auditors
      of public accompts, who thereupon debit the treasurer with the sum, and order the
      register of the land-office to give the party a warrant for his land. With this warrant
      from the register, he goes to the surveyor of the county where the land lies on which
      he has cast his eye. The surveyor lays it off for him, gives him its exact description,
      in the form of a certificate, which certificate he returns to the land-office, where
      a grant is made out, and is signed by the governor. This vests in him a perfect dominion
      in his lands, transmissible to whom he pleases by deed or will, or by descent to his
      heirs if he die intestate. <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1152b9" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1152b9" class="addEditorial">"Without a will."</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1154">Many of the laws which were in force during the monarchy being relative merely to
      that form of government, or inculcating principles inconsistent with republicanism,
      <span id="page-227" class="pagenum">[ 227 ]</span> the first assembly which met after the establishment of the commonwealth appointed
      a committee to revise the whole code, to reduce it into proper form and volume, and
      report it to the assembly. This work has been executed by three gentlemen, and reported;
      but probably will not be taken up till a restoration of peace shall leave to the legislature
      leisure to go through such a work.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1156">The plan of the revisal was this. The common law of England, by which is meant, that
      part of the English law which was anterior to the date of the oldest statutes extant,
      is made the basis of the work. It was thought dangerous to attempt to reduce it to
      a text: it was therefore left to be collected from the usual monuments of it. Necessary
      alterations in that, and so much of the whole body of the British statutes, and of
      acts of assembly, as were thought proper to be retained, were digested into 126 new
      acts, in which simplicity of stile was aimed at, as far as was safe. The following
      are the most remarkable alterations proposed:
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1158">To change the rules of descent, so as that the lands of any person dying intestate
      shall be divisible equally among all his children, or other representatives, in equal
      degree.
   </p>
   <p><span id="page-228" class="pagenum">[ 228 ]</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1162">To make slaves distributable among the next of kin, as other moveables.</p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1164">To have all public expences, whether of the general treasury, or of a parish or county,
      (as for the maintenance of the poor, building bridges, court-houses, &amp;c.) supplied
      by assessments on the citizens, in proportion to their property.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1166">To hire undertakers for keeping the public roads in repair, and indemnify individuals
      through whose lands new roads shall be opened.
   </p> 
   <p id="xw20aab3e1168">To define with precision the rules whereby aliens should become citizens, and citizens
      make themselves aliens.
   </p> 
   <p id="xw20aab3e1170">To establish religious freedom on the broadest bottom.</p> 
   <p id="xw20aab3e1172">To emancipate all slaves born after passing the act. The bill reported by the revisors
      does not itself contain this proposition; but an amendment containing it was prepared,
      to be offered to the legislature whenever the bill should be taken up, and further
      directing, that they should continue with their parents to a certain age, then be
      brought up, at the public expence, to tillage, arts or sciences, according to their
      geniusses, till the females should be eighteen, and the males twenty-one years of
      age, when they should be colonized to such place as the 
      <span id="page-229" class="pagenum">[ 229 ]</span> circumstances of the time should render most proper, sending them out with arms,
      implements of houshold and of the handicraft arts, seeds, pairs of the useful domestic
      animals, &amp;c. to declare them a free and independant people, and extend to them our
      alliance and protection, till they shall have acquired strength; and to send vessels
      at the same time to other parts of the world for an equal number of white inhabitants;
      to induce whom to migrate hither, proper encouragements were to be proposed. It will
      probably be asked, Why not retain and incorporate the blacks into the state, and thus
      save the expence of supplying, by importation of white settlers, the vacancies they
      will leave? Deep rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections,
      by the blacks, of the injuries they have sustained; new provocations; the real distinctions
      which nature has made; and many other circumstances, will divide us into parties,
      and produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of
      the one or the other race.&#8212;To these objections, which are political, may be added
      others, which are physical and moral. The first difference which strikes us is that
      of colour. Whether the black of the negro resides in the reticular membrane between
      the skin and scarf-skin, 
      <span id="page-230" class="pagenum">[ 230 ]</span> or in the scarf-skin <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172b5" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172b5" class="addEditorial">The outer layer of the skin; the cuticle.</span> itself; whether it proceeds from the colour of the blood, the colour of the bile,
      or from that of some other secretion, the difference is fixed in nature, and is as
      real as if its seat and cause were better known to us. And is this difference of no
      importance? Is it not the foundation of a greater or less share of beauty in the two
      races? Are not the fine mixtures of red and white, the expressions of every passion
      by greater or less suffusions of colour in the one, preferable to that eternal monotony,
      which reigns in the countenances, that immoveable veil of black which covers all the
      emotions of the other race? Add to these, flowing hair, a more elegant symmetry of
      form, their own judgment in favour of the whites, declared by their preference of
      them, as uniformly as is the preference of the Oranootan for the black women over
      those of his own species. The circumstance of superior beauty, is thought worthy attention
      in the propagation of our horses, dogs, and other domestic animals; why not in that
      of man? Besides those of colour, figure, and hair, there are other physical distinctions
      proving a difference of race. They have less hair on the face and body. They secrete
      less by the kidnies, and more by the glands of the skin, which gives them a very strong
      and 
      <span id="page-231" class="pagenum">[ 231 ]</span> disagreeable odour. This greater degree of transpiration renders them more tolerant
      of heat, and less so of cold, than the whites. Perhaps too a difference of structure
      in the pulmonary apparatus, which a late ingenious * experimentalist has discovered
      to be the principal regulator of animal heat, may have disabled them from extricating,
      in the act of inspiration, so much of that fluid from the outer air, or obliged them
      in expiration, to part with more of it. They seem to require less sleep. A black,
      after hard labour through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to
      sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out with the first dawn
      of the morning. They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome. But this may perhaps
      proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be
      present. When present, they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness
      than the whites. They are more ardent after their female; but love seems with them
      to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation.
      Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful
      whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner
      <span id="xw20aab3e1172b9" class="authorNote">* Crawford. <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172b9b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172b9b1" class="addEditorial">Adair Crawford (1748-1795) British chemist and medical doctor who was the author of

      <span id="page-232" class="pagenum">[ 232 ]</span> forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation
      than reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted
      from their diversions, and unemployed in labour.  An animal whose body is at rest,
      and who does not reflect, must be disposed to sleep of course. Comparing them by their
      faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me, that in memory they
      are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one could scarcely be
      found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid; and that
      in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous. It would be unfair to follow
      them to Africa for this investigation. We will consider them here, on the same stage
      with the whites, and where the facts are not apocryphal on which a judgment is to
      be formed. It will be right to make great allowances for the difference of condition,
      of education, of conversation, of the sphere in which they move. Many millions of
      them have been brought to, and born in America. Most of them indeed have been confined
      to tillage, to their own homes, and their own society: yet many have been so situated,
      that they might have availed themselves of the conversation of their masters; many
      have been brought up 
      <span id="page-233" class="pagenum">[ 233 ]</span> to the handicraft arts, and from that circumstance have always been associated with
      the whites. Some have been liberally educated, and all have lived in countries where
      the arts and sciences are cultivated to a considerable degree, and have had before
      their eyes samples of the best works from abroad. The Indians, with no advantages
      of this kind, will often carve figures on their pipes not destitute of design and
      merit. They will crayon out an animal, a plant, or a country, so as to prove the existence
      of a germ in their minds which only wants cultivation. They astonish you with strokes
      of the most sublime oratory; such as prove their reason and sentiment strong, their
      imagination glowing and elevated. But never yet could I find that a black had uttered
      a thought above the level of plain narration; never see even an elementary trait of
      painting or sculpture. In music they are more generally gifted than the whites with
      accurate ears for tune and time, and they have been found capable of imagining a small
      catch *. Whether they will be equal to the composition of a more extensive run of
      melody, or of complicated harmony, is 
      <span id="xw20aab3e1172c15" class="authorNote">* The instrument proper to them is the Banjar, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172c15b1" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172c15b1" class="addEditorial">The banjo, which many modern musicologists believe, as Jefferson does, originated

         chords being precisely the four lower chords of the guitar.</span>
      <span id="page-234" class="pagenum">[ 234 ]</span> yet to be proved. Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry.&#8211;&#8211;
      Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no poetry. Love is the peculiar

Their love is ardent, but it kindles the senses only, not the imagination.
      Religion indeed has produced a Phyllis Whately; <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172c21" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172c21" class="addEditorial">That is, Phillis Wheatley (1753-1784), African-American poet who became famous in
         the 1770s when her poems began to be published in American and British newspapers;
         her collected <i id="xw20aab3e1172c21b1">Poems on Various Subjects</i>, published in London in 1773, was also well received.</span> but it could not produce a poet. The compositions published under her name are below
      the dignity of criticism. The heroes of the Dunciad <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172c23" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172c23" class="addEditorial">Poem published in various versions by Alexander Pope between 1728 and 1743 that satirized
         the hack writers, pedantic critics, and other "dunces" of the popular press.</span> are to her, as Hercules to the author of that poem. Ignatius Sancho <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172c25" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172c25" class="addEditorial">Sancho (1729-1780) achieved fame during and after his lifetime for his writings, including
         letters in the press and the posthumously-published <i id="xw20aab3e1172c25b1">Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, An African</i>(1782). The "Shandean" style that Jefferson refers to here was widely noted by the
         readers of this book, as Sancho consciously imitated the style of Laurence's Sterne's
         <i id="xw20aab3e1172c25b3">Tristram Shandy</i> (1759-68).</span> has approached nearer to merit in composition; yet his letters do more honour to
      the heart than the head. They breathe the purest effusions of friendship and general
      philanthropy, and shew how great a degree of the latter may be compounded with strong
      religious zeal. He is often happy in the turn of his compliments, and his stile is
      easy and familiar, except when he affects a Shandean fabrication of words. But his
      imagination is wild and extravagant, escapes incessantly from every restraint of reason
      and taste, and, in the course of its vagaries, leaves a tract of thought as incoherent
      and eccentric, as is the course of a meteor through the sky. His subjects should often
      have led him to a process of sober reasoning: yet we find him always substituting
      <span id="page-235" class="pagenum">[ 235 ]</span> sentiment for demonstration. Upon the whole, though we admit him to the first place
      among those of his own colour who have presented themselves to the public judgment,
      yet when we compare him with the writers of the race among whom he lived, and particularly
      with the epistolary class, in which he has taken his own stand, we are compelled to
      enroll him at the bottom of the column. This criticism supposes the letters published
      under his name to be genuine, and to have received amendment from no other hand; points
      which would not be of easy investigation. The improvement of the blacks in body and
      mind, in the first instance of their mixture with the whites, has been observed by
      every one, and proves that their inferiority is not the effect: merely of their condition
      of life. We know that among the Romans, about the Augustan age especially, the condition
      of their slaves was much more deplorable than that of the blacks on the continent
      of America. The two sexes were confined in separate apartments, because to raise a
      child cost the master more than to buy one. Cato, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172c36" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172c36" class="addEditorial">Marcus Portius Cato (234-149 BCE) also known as Cato the Elder or Cato the Censor.</span> for a very restricted indulgence
      to his slaves in this particular, *  took from them a certain price. But in 
<span id="page-236" class="pagenum">[ 236 ]</span>
 this country the slaves multiply as fast as the free inhabitants. Their situation
      and manners place the commerce between the two sexes almost without restraint. &#8211; The
      same Cato, on a principle of &#339;conomy, always sold his sick and superannuated slaves. He gives
      it as a standing precept to a master visiting his farm, to sell his old oxen, old
      waggons, old tools, old and diseased servants, and every thing else become useless.
      'Vendat boves vetulos, plaustrum vetus, ferramenta vetera, servum senem, servum morbosum,
      &amp; si quid aliud supersit vendat.'

      It was the common practice to expose in the island of Æsculapius, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172c40" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172c40" class="addEditorial">Greek god of medicine.</span> in the Tyber, diseased slaves, <div id="xw20aab3e1172c42" class="marginNote">Suet. Claud. 25.</div> whose cure was like to become tedious. The Emperor Claudius, <span id="xw20aab3e1172c44" class="addEditorial">Claudius (10 BCE-54 CE) ruled as emperor of Rome from 41 to 54.</span> by an edict, gave freedom to such of them as should recover, and first declared,
      that if any person chose to kill rather than to expose them, it should be deemed homicide.
      The exposing them is a crime of which no instance has existed with us; and were it
      to be followed by death, it would be punished capitally. We are told of a certain
      Vedius Pollio, who, in the presence of Augustus, would have given a slave as food
      to his fish, for having broken a glass. <span id="page-237" class="pagenum">[ 237 ]</span>
 With the Romans, the regular method of taking the evidence of their slaves was under
      torture. Here it has been thought better never to resort to their evidence. When a
      master was murdered, all his slaves, in the same house, or within hearing, were condemned
      to death. Here punishment falls on the guilty only, and as precise proof is required
      against him as against a freeman. Yet notwithstanding these and other discouraging
      circumstances among the Romans, their slaves were often their rarest artists. They
      excelled too in science, insomuch as to be usually employed as tutors to their master's
      children. Epictetus, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1172c51" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1172c51" class="addEditorial">Epictetus (55-135), born a slave, became one of the best-known Stoic philosophers.</span> Terence, <span id="xw20aab3e1172c53" class="addEditorial">Publius Terentius Afer (c190 BCE-159 BCE), known as Terence, wrote several of the

         been a slave.</span> were slaves. But they were of the race of whites. It is not their condition then,
      but nature, which has produced the distinction.&#8212;&#8211;Whether further observation will
      or will not verify the conjecture, that nature has been less bountiful to them in
      the endowments of the head, I believe that in those of the heart she will be found
      to have done them justice. That disposition to theft with which they have been branded,
      must be ascribed to their situation, and not to any depravity of the moral sense.
      The man, in whose favour no laws of property exist, probably feels himself less bound
      to respect those made in favour of others. When arguing for ourselves, we lay <span id="page-238" class="pagenum">[ 238 ]</span> it down as a fundamental, that laws, to be just, must give a reciprocation of right:
      that, without this, they are mere arbitrary rules of conduct, founded in force, and
      not in conscience: and it is a problem which I give to the master to solve, whether
      the religious precepts against the violation of property were not framed for him as
      well as his slave? And whether the slave may not as justifiably take a little from
      one, who has taken all from him, as he may slay one who would slay him? That a change
      in the relations in which a man is placed should change his ideas of moral right and
      wrong, is neither new, nor peculiar to the colour of the blacks. Homer tells us it
      was so 2600 years ago.

Pope&#8217;s translation, published in 1725 and 1726, was the standard translation
      for almost all eighteenth-century English readers.</span></p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1180">But the slaves of which Homer speaks were whites. Notwithstanding these considerations
      which must weaken their respect for the laws of property, we find among them numerous
      instances of the most rigid integrity, and as many as among their better instructed
      masters, of benevolence, gratitude, and unshaken fidelity.&#8212;&#8211;The opinion, that they
      are inferior in the faculties of <span id="page-239" class="pagenum">[ 239 ]</span> reason and imagination, must be hazarded with great diffidence. To justify a general
      conclusion, requires many observations, even where the subject may be submitted to
      the Anatomical knife, to Optical glasses, to analysis by fire, or by solvents. How
      much more then where it is a faculty, not a substance, we are examining; where it
      eludes the research of all the senses; where the conditions of its existence are various
      and variously combined; where the effects of those which are present or absent bid
      defiance to calculation; let me add too, as a circumstance of great tenderness, where
      our conclusion would degrade a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of beings
      which their Creator may perhaps have given them. To our reproach it must be said,
      that though for a century and a half we have had under our eyes the races of black
      and of red men, they have never yet been viewed by us as subjects of natural history.
      I advance it therefore as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a
      distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the whites
      in the endowments both of body and mind. It is not against experience to suppose,
      that different species of the same genus, or varieties of the same species, may possess
      different <span id="page-240" class="pagenum">[ 240 ]</span> qualifications. Will not a lover of natural history then, one who views the gradations
      in all the races of animals with the eye of philosophy, excuse an effort to keep those
      in the department of man as distinct as nature has formed them? This unfortunate difference
      of colour, and perhaps of faculty, is a powerful obstacle to the emancipation of these
      people. Many of their advocates, while they wish to vindicate the liberty of human
      nature, are anxious also to preserve its dignity and beauty. Some of these, embarrassed
      by the question 'What further is to be done with them ?' join themselves in opposition
      with those who are actuated by sordid avarice only. Among the Romans emancipation
      required but one effort. The slave, when made free, might mix with, without staining
      the blood of his master. But with us a second is necessary, unknown to history. When
      freed, he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1190">Pardon and privilege of clergy are proposed to be abolished; but if the verdict be
      against the defendant, the court in their discretion, may allow a new trial. No attainder
      to cause a corruption of blood, or forfeiture of dower. Slaves guilty of offences
      punishable in others by labour, to be transported to Africa, or elsewhere, as the

      proposed for those condemned to labour.
   </p> 
   <p id="xw20aab3e1192">Another object of the revisal is to diffuse knowledge more generally through the mass
      of the people. This bill proposes to lay off every county into small districts of
      five or six miles square, called hundreds, and in each of them to establish a school
      for teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic. The tutor to be supported by the hundred,
      and every person in it entitled to send their children three years gratis, and as
      much longer as they please, paying for it. These schools to be under a visitor, who
      is annually to chuse the boy, of best genius in the school, of those whose parents
      are too poor to give them further education, and to send him forward to one of the
      grammar schools, of which twenty are proposed to be erected in differents parts of
      the country, for teaching Greek, Latin, geography, and the higher <span id="page-244" class="pagenum">[ 244 ]</span> branches of numerical arithmetic. Of the boys thus sent in any one year, trial is
      to be made at the grammar schools one or two years, and the best genius of the whole
      selected, and continued six years, and the residue dismissed. By this means twenty
      of the best geniusses will be raked from the rubbish annually, and be instructed,
      at the public expence, so far as the grammer schools go. At the end of six years instruction,
      one half are to be discontinued (from among whom the grammar schools will probably
      be supplied with future masters); and the other half, who are to be chosen for the
      superiority of their parts and disposition, are to be sent and continued three years
      in the study of such sciences as they shall chuse, at William and Mary college, the
      plan of which is proposed to be enlarged, as will be hereafter explained, and extended
      to all the useful sciences. The ultimate result of the whole scheme of education would
      be the teaching all the children of the state reading, writing, and common arithmetic:
      turning out ten annually of superior genius, well taught in Greek, Latin, geography,
      and the higher branches of arithmetic: turning out ten others annually, of still superior
      parts, who, to those branches of learning, shall have added such of the sciences as
      their <span id="page-245" class="pagenum">[ 245 ]</span> genius shall have led them to: the furnishing to the wealthier part of the people
      convenient schools, at which their children may be educated, at their own expence.&#8211;&#8211;The
      general objects of this law are to provide an education adapted to the years, to the
      capacity, and the condition of every one, and directed to their freedom and happiness.
      Specific details were not proper for the law. These must be the business of the visitors
      entrusted with its execution. The first stage of this education being the schools
      of the hundreds, wherein the great mass of the people will receive their instruction,
      the principal foundations of future order will be laid here. Instead therefore of
      putting the Bible and Testament into the hands of the children, at an age when their
      judgments are not sufficiently matured for religious enquiries, their memories may
      here be stored with the most useful facts from Grecian, Roman, European and American
      history. The first elements of morality too may be instilled into their minds; such
      as, when further developed as their judgments advance in strength, may teach them
      how to work out their own greatest happiness, by shewing them that it does not depend
      on the condition of life in which chance has placed them, but is always the result
      of a <span id="page-246" class="pagenum">[ 246 ]</span> good conscience, good health, occupation, and freedom in all just pursuits.&#8212;&#8211;Those
      whom either the wealth of their parents or the adoption of the state shall destine
      to higher degrees of learning, will go on to the grammar schools, which constitute
      the next stage, there to be instructed in the languages. The learning Greek and Latin,
      I am told, is going into disuse in Europe. I know not what their manners and occupations
      may call for: but it would be very ill-judged in us to follow their example in this
      instance. There is a certain period of life, say from eight to fifteen or sixteen
      years of age, when the mind, like the body, is not yet firm enough for laborious and
      close operations. If applied to such, it falls an early victim to premature exertion;
      exhibiting indeed at first, in these young and tender subjects, the flattering appearance
      of their being men while they are yet children, but ending in reducing them to be
      children when they should be men. The memory is then most susceptible and tenacious
      of impressions; and the learning of languages being chiefly a work of memory, it seems
      precisely fitted to the powers of this period, which is long enough too for acquiring
      the most useful languages antient and modern. I do not pretend that language is science.
<span id="page-247" class="pagenum">[ 247 ]</span>
 It is only an instrument for the attainment of science. But that time is not lost
      which is employed in providing tools for future operation: more especially as in this
      case the tools put into the hands of the youth for this purpose may be such as will
      at the same time impress their minds with useful facts and good principles. If this
      period be suffered to pass in idleness, the mind becomes lethargic and impotent, as
      would the body it inhabits if unexercised during the same time. The sympathy between
      body and mind during their rise, progress and decline, is to strict and obvious to
      endanger our being misled while we reason from the one to the other.&#8211;&#8211;As soon as they
      are of sufficient age, it is supposed they will be sent on from the grammar schools
      to the university, which constitutes our third and last stage, there to study those
      sciences which may be adapted to their views.&#8211;&#8211;By that part of our plan which prescribes
      the selection of the youths of genius from among the classes of the poor, we hope
      to avail the state of those talents which nature has sown as liberally, among the
      poor as the rich, but which perish without use, if not sought for and cultivated.&#8211;&#8211;But
      of all the views of this law none is more important, none more legitimate, than that
      of rendering the people <span id="page-248" class="pagenum">[ 248 ]</span> the safe, as they are the ultimate, guardians of their own liberty. For this purpose
      the reading in the first stage, where they will receive their whole education, is
      proposed, as has been said, to be chiefly historical. History by apprising them of
      the past will enable them to judge of the future; it will avail them of the experience
      of other times and other nations; it will qualify them as judges of the actions and
      designs of men; it will enable them to know ambition under every disguise it may assume;
      and knowing it, to defeat its views. In every government on earth is some trace of
      human weakness, some germ of corruption and degeneracy, which cunning will discover,
      and wickedness insensibly open, cultivate, and improve. Every government degenerates
      when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves therefore are
      its only safe depositories. And to render even them safe their minds must be improved
      to a certain degree. This indeed is not all that is necessary, though it be essentially
      necessary. An amendment of our constitution must here come in aid of the public education.
      The influence over government must be shared among all the people. If every individual
which composes their mass participates of the ultimate authority, the <span id="page-249" class="pagenum">[ 249 ]</span>
 government will be safe; because the corrupting the whole mass will exceed any private
      resources of wealth: and public ones cannot be provided but by levies on the people.
      In this case every man would have to pay his own price. The government of Great-Britain
      has been corrupted, because but one man in ten has a right to vote for members of
      parliament. The sellers of the government therefore get nine-tenths of their price
      clear. It has been thought that corruption is restrained by confining the right of
      suffrage to a few of the wealthier of the people: but it would be more effectually
      restrained by an extension of that right to such numbers as would bid defiance to
      the means of corruption.

   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1202">The college of William and Mary is the only public seminary of learning in this state.
      It was founded in the time of king William <span id="page-250" class="pagenum">[ 250 ]</span> and queen Mary, who granted to it 20,000 acres of land, and a penny a pound duty
      on certain tobaccoes exported from Virginia and Maryland, which had been levied by
      the statute of 25 Car. 2. The assembly also gave it, by temporary laws, a duty on
      liquors imported, and skins and firs exported. From these resources it received upwards
    of 3000 l. communibus annis. <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1202b3" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1202b3" class="addEditorial">Latin: "in an average year."</span> The buildings are of brick, sufficient for an indifferent accommodation of perhaps
      an hundred students. By its chapter it was to be under the government of twenty visitors,
      who were to be its legislators, and to have a president and six professors who were
      incorporated. It was allowed a representative in the general assembly. Under this
      charter, a professorship of the Greek and Latin languages, a professorship of mathematics,
      one of moral philosophy, and two of divinity, were established. To these were annexed,
      for a sixth professorship, a considerable donation by Mr. Boyle of England, <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1202b5" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1202b5" class="addEditorial">The chemist Robert Boyle (1627-1691). After he died, his estate was used to purchase
         Brafferton Manor in Yorkshire, and the proceeds from this land became what was known
         as the "Boyle Fund," money used to support the education of Indians in the colonies.
         The new College of William and Mary in Virginia applied in the 1690s for money from
         the fund, and used it to found an Indian grammar school, which lasted until access
         to the Fund dried up after the American Revolution.</span> for the instruction of the Indians, and their conversion to Christianity. This was
      called the professorship of Brafferton, from an estate of that name in England, purchased
      with the monies given. The admission of the learners of Latin and Greek filled the
      college with children. This rendering it disagreeable and degrading to <span id="page-251" class="pagenum">[ 251 ]</span> young gentlemen already prepared for entering on the sciences, they were discouraged
      from resorting to it, and thus the schools for mathematics and moral philosophy, which
      might have been of some service, became of very little. The revenues too were exhausted
      in accommodating those who came only to acquire the rudiments of science. After the
      present revolution, the visitors, having no power to change those circumstances in
      the constitution of the college which were fixed by the charter, and being therefore
      confined in the number of professorships, undertook to change the objects of the professorships.
      They excluded the two schools for divinity, and that for the Greek and Latin languages,
      and substituted others; so that at present they stand thus:
   </p>
   <li>&#8195; &#8195; A Professorship for Law and Police:</li> &#8232;    
   <li>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; Anatomy and Medicine:</li> &#8232;    
   <li>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195; Natural Philosophy and Mathematics: </li>&#8232;    
   <li>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Moral Philosophy, the Law of Nature and Nations, the Fine Arts:</li>&#8232;     
   <li>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Modern Languages:</li> &#8232;
   <li>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;For the Brafferton.</li> 
   <p id="xw20aab3e1216">And it is proposed, so soon as the legislature shall have leisure to take up this
      subject, to desire authority from them to increase the number of professorships, as
      well for the purpose of subdividing those already instituted, <span id="page-252" class="pagenum">[ 252 ]</span> as of adding others for other branches of science. To the professorships usually
      established in the universities of Europe, it would seem proper to add one for the
      antient languages and literature of the North, on account of their connection with
      our own language, laws, customs, and history. The purposes of the Brafferton institution
      would be better answered by maintaining a perpetual mission among the Indian tribes,
      the object of which, besides instructing them in the principles of Christianity, as
      the founder requires, should be to collect their traditions, laws, customs, languages,
      and other circumstances which might lead to a discovery of their relation with one
      another, or descent from other nations. When these objects are accomplished with one
      tribe, the missionary might pass on to another.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1218">The roads are under the government of the county courts, subject to be controuled
      by the general court. They order new roads to be opened wherever they think them necessary.
      The inhabitants of the county are by them laid off into precincts, to each of which
      they allot a convenient portion of the public roads to be kept in repair. Such bridges
      as may be built without the assistance of artificers, they are to build. If the stream
      be such as to require a bridge of regular 
      <span id="page-253" class="pagenum">[ 253 ]</span> workmanship, the court employs workmen to build it, at the expence of the whole county.
      If it be too great for the county, application is made to the general assembly, who
      authorize individuals to build it, and to take a fixed toll from all passengers, or
      give sanction to such other proposition as to them appears reasonable.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1220">Ferries are admitted only at such places as are particularly pointed out by law, and
      the rates of ferriage are fixed.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1222">Taverns are licensed by the courts, who fix their rates from time to time.</p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1224">The private buildings are very rarely constructed of stone or brick; much the greatest
      proportion being of scantling and boards, plaistered with lime. It is impossible to
      devise things more ugly, uncomfortable, and happily more perishable. There are two
      or three plans, on one of which, according to its size, most of the houses in the
      state are built. The poorest people build huts of logs, laid horizontally in pens,
      stopping the interstices with mud. These are warmer in winter, and cooler in summer,
      than the more expensive constructions of scantling and plank. The wealthy are attentive
      to the raising of vegetables, but very little so to fruits. The poorer people attend
      to neither, living principally on milk and animal diet. This is 
      <span id="page-254" class="pagenum">[ 254 ]</span> the more inexcusable, as the climate requires indispensably a free use of vegetable
      food, for health as well as comfort, and is very friendly to the raising of fruits.&#8211;&#8211;The
      only public buildings worthy mention are the Capitol, the Palace, the College, and
      the Hospital for Lunatics, all of them in Williamsburg, heretofore the seat of our
      government. The Capitol is a light and airy structure, with a portico in front of
      two orders, the lower of which, being Doric, is tolerably just in its proportions
      and ornaments, save only that the intercolonnations are too large. The upper is Ionic,
      much too small for that on which it is mounted, its ornaments not proper to the order,
      nor proportioned within themselves. It is crowned with a pediment, which is too high
      for its span. Yet, on the whole, it is the most pleasing piece of architecture we
      have. The Palace is not handsome without: but it is spacious and commodious within,
      is prettily situated, and, with the grounds annexed to it, is capable of being made
      an elegant seat. The College and Hospital are rude, mis-shapen piles, which, but that
      they have roofs, would be taken for brick-kilns. There are no other public buildings
      but churches and courthouses, in which no attempts are made at elegance. Indeed it
      would not be easy to 
      <span id="page-255" class="pagenum">[ 255 ]</span> execute such an attempt, as a workman could scarcely be found here capable of drawing
      an order. The genius of architecture seems to have shed its maledictions over this
      land. Buildings are often erected, by individuals, of considerable expence. To give
      these symmetry and taste would not increase their cost. It would only change the arrangement
      of the materials, the form and combination of the members. This would often cost less
      than the burthen of barbarous ornaments with which these buildings are sometimes charged.
      But the first principles of the art are unknown, and there exists scarcely a model
      among us sufficiently chaste to give an idea of them. Architecture being one of the
      fine arts, and as such within the department of a professor of the college, according
      to the new arrangement, perhaps a spark may fall on some young subjects of natural
      taste, kindle up their genius, and produce a reformation in this elegant and useful
      art. But all we shall do in this way will produce no permanent improvement to our
      country, while the unhappy prejudice prevails that houses of brick or stone are less
      wholesome than those of wood. A dew is often observed on the walls of the former in
      rainy weather, and the most obvious solution is, that the rain has penetrated through
      these walls. The 
      <span id="page-256" class="pagenum">[ 256 ]</span> following facts however are sufficient to prove the error of this solution. &#8195;1.&#8195;
      This dew on the walls appears when there is no rain, if the state of the atmosphere
      be moist. &#8195;2.&#8195; It appears on the partition as well as the exterior walls. &#8195;3.&#8195; So
      also on pavements of brick or stone. &#8195;4.&#8195; It is more copious in proportion as the
      walls are thicker; the reverse of which ought to be the case, if this hypothesis were
      just. If cold water be poured into a vessel of stone, or glass, a dew forms instantly
      on the outside: but if it be poured into a vessel of wood, there is no such appearance.
      It is not supposed, in the first case, that the water has exuded through the glass,
      but that it is precipitated from the circumambient air; as the humid particles of
      vapour, passing from the boiler of an alembic through its refrigerant, are precipitated
      from the air, in which they were suspended, on the internal surface of the refrigerant.
      Walls of brick or stone act as the refrigerant in this instance. They are sufficiently
      cold to condense and precipitate the moisture suspended in the air of the room, when
      it is heavily charged therewith. But walls of wood are not so. The question then is,
      whether air in which this moisture is left floating, or that which is deprived of
      it, be most wholesome? In both cases the remedy 
      <span id="page-257" class="pagenum">[ 257 ]</span> is easy. A little fire kindled in the room, whenever the air is damp, prevents the
      precipitation on the walls: and this practice, found healthy in the warmest as well
      as coldest seasons, is as necessary in a wooden as in a stone or a brick house. I
      do not mean to say, that the rain never penetrates through walls of brick. On the
      contrary I have seen instances of it. But with us it is only through the northern
      and eastern walls of the house, after a north-easterly storm, these being the only
      ones which continue long enough to force through the walls. This however happens too
      rarely to give a just character of unwholesomeness to such houses. In a house, the
      walls of which are of well-burnt brick and good mortar, I have seen the rain penetrate
      through but twice in a dozen or fifteen years. The inhabitants of Europe, who dwell
      chiefly in houses of stone or brick, are surely as healthy as those of Virginia. These
      houses have the advantage too of being warmer in winter and cooler in summer than
      those of wood; of being cheaper in their first construction, where lime is convenient,
      and infinitely more durable. The latter consideration renders it of great importance
      to eradicate this prejudice from the minds of our countrymen. A country whose buildings
      are of wood, can 
      <span id="page-258" class="pagenum">[ 258 ]</span> never increase in its improvements to any considerable degree. Their duration is
      highly estimated at 50 years. Every half century then our country becomes a tabula
      rasa, whereon we have to set out anew, as in the first moment of seating it. Whereas
      when buildings are of durable materials, every new edifice is an actual and permanent
      acquisition to the state, adding to its value as well as to its ornament.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1230">THE measures taken with regard of the estates and possessions of the rebels, commonly
      called Tories?
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1232">A Tory has been properly defined to be a traitor in thought, but not in deed. The
      only description, by which the laws have endeavoured to come at them, was that of
      nonjurors, or persons refusing to take the oath of fidelity to the state. Persons
      of this description were at one time subjected to double taxation, at another to treble,
      and lastly were allowed retribution, and placed on a level with good citizens. It
      may be mentioned as a proof both of the lenity of our government, and unanimity of
      its inhabitants, that 
      <span id="page-259" class="pagenum">[ 259 ]</span> though this war has now raged near seven years, not a single execution for treason
      has taken place.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1234">Under this query I will state the measures which have been adopted as to British property,
      the owners of which stand on a much fairer footing than the Tories. By our laws, the
      same as the English in this respect, no alien can hold lands, nor alien enemy maintain
      an action for money, or other moveable thing. Lands acquired or held by aliens become
      forfeited to the state; and, on an action by an alien enemy to recover money, or other
      moveable property, the defendant may plead that he is an alien enemy. This extinguishes
      his right in the hands of the debtor or holder of his moveable property. By our separation
      from Great-Britain, British subjects became aliens, and being at war, they were alien
      enemies. Their lands were of course forfeited, and their debts irrecoverable. The
      assembly however passed laws, at various times, for saving their property. They first
      sequestered their lands, slaves, and other property on their farms, in the hands of
      commissioners, who were mostly the confidential friends or agents of the owners, and
      directed their clear profits to be paid into the treasury: and they gave leave to
      all persons owing debts to British subjects, to pay them 
      <span id="page-260" class="pagenum">[ 260 ]</span> also into the treasury. The monies so to be brought in were declared to remain the
      property of the British subject, and, if used by the state, were to be repaid, unless
      an improper conduct in Great-Britain should render a detention of it reasonable. Depreciation
      had at that time, though unacknowledged and unperceived by the Whigs, begun in some
      small degree. Great sums of money were paid in by debtors. At a later period, the
      assembly, adhering to the political principles which forbid an alien to hold lands
      in the state, ordered all British property to be sold: and, become sensible of the
      real progress of depreciation, and of the losses which would thence occur, if not
      guarded against, they ordered that the proceeds of the sales should be converted into
      their then worth in tobacco, subject to the future direction of the legislature. This
      act has left the question of retribution more problematical. In May 1780 another act
      took away the permission to pay into the public treasury debts due to British subjects.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1242">THE different religions received into that state?
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1244">The first settlers in this country were emigrants from England, of the English church,
      just at a point of time when it was flushed with complete victory over the religious
      of all other persuasions. Possessed, as they became, of the powers of making, administering,
      and executing the laws, they shewed equal intolerance in this country with their Presbyterian
      brethren, who had emigrated to the northern government. The poor Quakers were flying
      from persecution in England. They cast their eyes on these new countries as asylums
      of civil and religious freedom; but they found them free only for the reigning sect.
      Several acts of the Virginia assembly of 1659, 1662, and 1693, had made it penal in
      parents to refuse to have their children baptized; had prohibited the unlawful assembling
      of Quakers; had made it penal for any master of a vessel to bring a Quaker into the
      state; had ordered those already here, and such as should come thereafter, to be imprisoned
      till they should abjure the country; provided a milder 
      <span id="page-262" class="pagenum">[ 262 ]</span> punishment for their first and second return, but death for their third; had inhibited
      all persons from suffering their meetings in or near their houses, entertaining them
      individually, or disposing of books which supported their tenets. If no capital execution
      took place here, as did, in New-England, it was not owing to the moderation of the
      church, or spirit, of the legislature, as may be inferred from the law itself; but
      to historical circumstances which have not been handed down to us. The Anglicans retained
      full possession of the country about a century. Other opinions began then to creep
      in, and the great care of the government to support their own church, having begotten
      an equal degree of indolence in its clergy, two-thirds of the people had become dissenters
      at the commencement of the present revolution. The laws indeed were still oppressive
      on them, but the spirit of the one party had subsided into moderation, and of the
      other had risen to a degree of determination which commanded respect.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1246">The present state of our laws on the subject of religion is this. The convention of
      May 1776, in their declaration of rights, declared it to be a truth, and a natural
      right, that the exercise of religion should be free; but when they proceeded to form
      on that 
      <span id="page-263" class="pagenum">[ 263 ]</span> declaration the ordinance of government, instead of taking up every principle declared
      in the bill of rights, and guarding it by legislative sanction, they passed over that
      which asserted our religious rights, leaving them as they found them. The same convention,
      however, when they met as a member of the general assembly in October 1776, repealed
      all <i>acts of parliament</i> which had rendered criminal the maintaining any opinions in
      matters of religion, the forbearing to repair to church, and the exercising any mode
      of worship; and suspended the laws giving salaries to the clergy, which suspension
      was made perpetual in October 1779. Statutory oppressions in religion being thus wiped
      away, we remain at present under those only imposed by the common law, or by our own
      acts of assembly. At the common law, heresy was a capital offence, punishable by burning.
      Its definition was left to the ecclesiastical judges, before whom the conviction was,
      till the statute of the I El. c. I. <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1246b3" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1246b3" class="addEditorial">The Act of Supremacy, passed in 1558, the first year of Queen Elizabeth I's reign,

      the express and plain words of the scriptures. 
      <span id="page-264" class="pagenum">[ 264 ]</span> Heresy, thus circumscribed, being an offence at the common law, our act of assembly
      of &#8232;October 1777, c. 17. gives cognizance of it &#8232;to the general court, by declaring,
      that the &#8232;jurisdiction of that court shall be general in all matters at the common

      religion denies the being of a God, or the &#8232;Trinity, or asserts there are more Gods
      than &#8232;one, or denies the Christian religion to be &#8232;true, or the scriptures to be of
      divine authority, he is punishable on the first offence by incapacity to hold any
      office or employment ecclesiastical, civil, or military; on the &#8232;second by disability
      to sue, to take any gift &#8232;or legacy, to be guardian, executor, or administrator, and
      by three years imprisonment, &#8232;without bail. A father's right to the custody of his
      own children being founded in law on &#8232;his right of guardianship, this being taken
      &#8232;away, they may of course be severed from &#8232;him, and put, by the authority of a court,
      &#8232;into more orthodox hands. This is a summary view of that religious slavery, under
      &#8232;which a people have been willing to remain,&#8232;who have lavished their lives and fortunes
      &#8232;for the establishment of their civil freedom. &#8232;* The error seems not sufficiently

 eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are
      subject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over such natural
      rights only as we have submitted to them. The rights of conscience we never submitted,
      we could not submit. We are answerable for them to our God. The legitimate powers
      of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me
      no injury for my neighbour to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks
      my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be said, his testimony in a court of justice cannot
      be relied on, reject it then, and be the stigma on him. Constraint may make him worse
      by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him
      obstinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Reason and free enquiry are the
      only effectual agents against error. Give a loose to them, they will support the true
      religion, by bringing every false one to their tribunal, to the test of their investigation.
      They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government
      permitted free enquiry, Christianity could never have been introduced. Had not free
      enquiry been indulged, at the æra of the reformation, the corruptions of Christianity
      <span id="page-266" class="pagenum">[ 266 ]</span>
      could not have been purged away. If it be restrained now, the present corruptions
      will be protected, and new ones encouraged. Was the government to prescribe to us
      our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now. Thus
      in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medicine, and the potatoe as an article
      of food. Government is just as infallible too when it fixes systems in physics. Galileo
      was sent to the inquisition for affirming that the earth was a sphere: the government
      had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his
      error. This error however at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and Descartes
      declared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex. The government in which he lived
      was wise enough to see that this was no question of civil jurisdiction, or we should
      all have been involved by authority in vortices. In fact, the vortices have been exploded,
      and the Newtonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly established, on the
      basis of reason, than it would be were the government to step in, and to make it an
      article of necessary faith. Reason, and experiment have been indulged, and error has
      fled before them. It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can
      stand by 
      <span id="page-267" class="pagenum">[ 267 ]</span> itself. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inquisitors? Fallible
      men; men governed by bad passions, by private as well as public reasons. And why subject
      it to coercion? To produce uniformity. But is uniformity of opinion desireable? No
      more than of face and stature. Introduce the bed of Procrustes then, and as there
      is danger that the large men may beat the small, make us all of a size, by lopping
      the former and stretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion.
    The several sects perform the office of a Censor morum <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1246c27" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1246c27" class="addEditorial">Latin: "critic of morals"</span> over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women, and children,
      since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned;
      yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of
      coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support
      roguery and error all over the earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thousand
      millions of people. That these profess probably a thousand different systems of religion.
      That ours is but one of that thousand. That if there be but one right, and ours that
      one, we should wish to see the 999 wandering sects gathered into the fold of truth.
      But against such a majority we 
      <span id="page-268" class="pagenum">[ 268 ]</span> cannot effect this by force. Reason and persuasion are the only practicable instruments.
      To make way for these, free enquiry must be indulged; and how can we wish others to
      indulge it while we refuse it ourselves. But every state, says an inquisitor, has
      established some religion. No two, say I, have established the same. Is this a proof
      of the infallibility of establishments? Our sister states of Pennsylvania and New
      York, however, have long subsisted without any establishment at all. The experiment
      was new and doubtful when they made it. It has answered beyond conception. They flourish
      infinitely. Religion is well supported; of various kinds, indeed, but all good enough;
      all sufficient to preserve peace and order: or if a sect arises, whose tenets would
      subvert morals, good sense has fair play, and reasons and laughs it out of doors,
      without suffering the state to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors
      than we do. They are not more disturbed with religious dissensions. On the contrary,
      their harmony is unparalleled, and can be ascribed to nothing but their unbounded
      tolerance, because there is no other circumstance in which they differ from every
      nation on earth. They have made the happy discovery, that the way to silence religious
      disputes, is to take no notice of them. Let 
      <span id="page-269" class="pagenum">[ 269 ]</span> us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of those tyrannical
      laws. It is true, we are as yet secured against them by the spirit of the times. I
      doubt whether the people of this country would suffer an execution for heresy, or
      a three years imprisonment for not comprehending the mysteries of the Trinity. But
      is the spirit of the people an infallible, a permanent reliance? Is it government?
      Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Besides,
      the spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our
      people careless. A single zealot may commence persecutor, and better men be his victims.
      It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every essential right
      on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest, and ourselves united. From the conclusion
      of this war we shall be going down hill. It will not then be necessary to resort every
      moment to the people for support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights
      disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money,
      and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The shackles,
      therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain
      on us long, will be made 
      <span id="page-270" class="pagenum">[ 270 ]</span> heavier and heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion.

   <div id="xw20aab3e1250" class="marginNote">Manners.</div> 
   <p id="xw20aab3e1252">THE <i id="xw20aab3e1252b2">particular</i> customs and manners that may happen to be received in that state?
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1254">It is difficult to determine on the standard by which the manners of a nation may be
      tried, whether <i id="xw20aab3e1254b1">catholic</i>, or <i id="xw20aab3e1254b3">particular</i>. It is more difficult for a native to bring to that standard the manners of his own
      nation, familiarized to him by habit. There must doubtless be an unhappy influence
      on the manners of our people produced by the existence of slavery among us. The whole
      commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions,
      the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading submissions on the other.
      Our children see this, and learn to imitate it; for man is an imitative animal. This
      quality is the germ of all education in him. From his cradle to his grave he is learning
      to do what he sees others do. If a parent could find no motive either in his philanthropy
      or his self-love, for restraining 
      <span id="page-271" class="pagenum">[ 271 ]</span>
      the intemperance of passion towards his slave, it should always be a sufficient one
      that his child is present. But generally it is not sufficient. The parent storms,
      the child looks on, catches the lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs in the
      circle of smaller slaves, gives a loose to his worst of passions, and thus nursed,
      educated, and daily exercised in tyranny, cannot but be stamped by it with odious
      peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved
      by such circumstances. And with what execration should the statesman be loaded, who
      permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other, transforms
      those into despots, and, these into enemies, destroys the morals of the one part,
      and the amor patriæ of the other. For if a slave can have a country in this world
      it must be any other in preference to that in which he is born to live and labour
      for another: in which he must lock up the faculties of his nature, contribute as far
      as depends on his individual endeavours to the evanishment of the human race, or entail
      his own miserable condition on the endless generations proceeding from him. With the
      morals of the people, their industry also is destroyed. For in a warm climate, no
      man will labour for 
      <span id="page-272" class="pagenum">[ 272 ]</span> himself who can make another labour for him. This is so true, that of the proprietors
      of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour. And can the liberties
      of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction
      in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they
      are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I
      reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep for ever: that considering
      numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange
      of situation, is among possible events: that it may become probable by supernatural
      interference! The Almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a
      contest. &#8212;But it is impossible to be temperate and to pursue this subject through
      the various considerations of policy, of morals, of history natural and civil. We
      must be contented to hope they will force their way into every one's mind. I think
      a change already perceptible, since the origin of the present revolution. The spirit
      of the master is abating, that of the slave rising from the dust, his condition mollifying,
      the way I hope preparing, under the auspices of heaven, for a total emancipation,
      and that this is 
      <span id="page-273" class="pagenum">[ 273 ]</span>
 disposed, in the order of events, to be with the consent of the masters, rather than
      by their extirpation.

   <div id="xw20aab3e1258" class="marginNote">Manufactures.</div>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1260">THE present state of manufactures, commerce, interior and exterior trade?
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1262">We never had an interior trade of any importance. Our exterior commerce has suffered
      very much from the beginning of the present contest. During this time we have manufactured
      within our families the most necessary articles of cloathing. Those of cotton will
      bear some comparison with the same kinds of manufacture in Europe; but those of wool,
      flax and hemp are very coarse, unsightly, and unpleasant: and such is our attachment
      to agriculture, and such our preference for foreign manufactures, that be it wise
      of unwise, our people will certainly return as soon as they can, to the raising raw
      materials, and exchanging them for finer manufactures than they are able to execute
      themselves.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1264">The political oeconomists of Europe have established it as a principle that every
      state 
      <span id="page-274" class="pagenum">[ 274 ]</span> should endeavour to manufacture for itself: and this principle, like many others,
      we transfer to America, without calculating the difference of circumstance which should
      often produce a difference of result. In Europe the lands are either cultivated, or
      locked up against the cultivator. Manufacture must therefore be resorted to of necessity
      not of choice, to support the surplus of their people. But we have an immensity of
      land courting the industry of the husbandman. Is it best then that all our citizens
      should be employed in its improvement, or that one half should be called off from
      that to exercise manufactures and handicraft arts for the other? Those who labour
      in the earth are the chosen people of God, if ever he had a chosen people, whose breasts
      he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue. It is the focus
      in which he keeps alive that sacred fire, which otherwise might escape from the face
      of the earth. Corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators is a phænomenon of which
      no age nor nation has furnished an example. It is the mark set on those, who not looking
      up to heaven, to their own soil and industry, as does the husbandman, for their subsistance,
      depend for it on the casualties and caprice of customers. Dependance begets subservience
      and venality, suffocates the germ of virtue, 
      <span id="page-275" class="pagenum">[ 275 ]</span>
 and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition. This, the natural progress and
      consequence of the arts, has sometimes perhaps been retarded by accidental circumstances:
      but, generally speaking, the proportion which the aggregate of the other classes of
      citizens bears in any state to that of its husbandmen, is the proportion of its unsound
      to its healthy parts, and is a good-enough barometer whereby to measure its degree
      of corruption. While we have land to labour then, let us never wish to see our citizens
      occupied at a work-bench, or twirling a distaff. Carpenters, masons, smiths, are wanting
      in husbandry: but, for the general operations of manufacture, let our work-shops remain
      in Europe. It is better to carry provisions and materials to workmen there, than bring
      them to the provisions and materials, and with them their manners and principles.
      The loss by the transportation of commodities across the Atlantic will be made up
      in happiness and permanence of government. The mobs of great cities add just so much
      to the support of pure government, as sores do to the strength of the human body.
      It is the manners and spirit of a people which preserve a republic in vigour. A degeneracy
      in these is a canker which soon eats to the heart of its laws and constitution.

         could be used for storing and shipping beer, wine, molasses, or, as here, tobacco.</span> of tobacco, which was the greatest quantity ever produced in this country in one
      year. But its culture was fast declining at the commencement of this war and that
      of wheat taking its place: and it must continue to decline on the return of peace.
      I suspect that the change in the temperature of our climate has become sensible to
      that plant, which, to be good, requires an extraordinary degree of heat. But it requires
      still more indispensably an uncommon fertility of soil: and the price which it commands
      at market will not enable the planter to produce this by manure. Was the supply still
      to depend on Virginia and Maryland alone, as its culture becomes more difficult, the
      price would rise, so as to enable the planter to surmount those difficulties and to
      live. But the western country on the Missisipi, and the midlands of Georgia, having
      fresh and fertile lands in abundance, and hotter sun, will be able to undersell these
      two states, and will oblige them to abandon the raising tobacco altogether. And a
      happy obligation for them it wi|l be. It is a culture productive of infinite wretchedness.
      Those employed in it are in a continued state of exertion beyond the powers of nature
      to support. Little <span id="page-279" class="pagenum">[ 279 ]</span> food of any kind is raised by them so that the men and animals on these farms are
      badly fed, and the earth is rapidly impoverished. The cultivation of wheat is the
      reverse in every circumstance. Besides cloathing the earth with herbage, and preserving
      its fertility, it feeds the labourers plentifully, requires from them only a moderate
      toil, except in the season of harvest, raises great numbers of animals for food and
      service, and diffuses plenty and happiness among the whole. We find it easier to make
      an hundred bushels of wheat than a thousand weight of tobacco, and they are worth
      more when made. The weavil <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1282b5" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1282b5" class="addEditorial">The wheat weevil, an agricultural pest. The female lays eggs inside the kernels of
         grain, which are then consumed by the larvae.</span> indeed is a formidable obstacle to the cultivation of this grain with us. But principles
      are already known which must lead to a remedy. Thus a certain degree of heat, to wit,
      that of the common air in summer, is necessary to hatch the egg. If subterranean granaries,
      or others, therefore, can be contrived below that temperature, the evil will be cured
      by cold. A degree of heat beyond that which hatches the egg, we know will kill it.
      But in aiming at this we easily run into that which produces, putrefaction. To produce
      putrefaction, however, three agents are requisite, heat, moisture, and the external
      air. Is the absence of any one of these be secured, the other 
      <span id="page-280" class="pagenum">[ 280 ]</span> two may safely be admitted. Heat is the one we want. Moisture then, or external air,
      must be excluded. The former has been done by exposing the grain in kilns to the action
      of fire, which produces heat, and extracts moisture at the same time: the latter,
      by putting the grain into hogsheads, covering it with a coat of lime, and heading
      it up. In this situation its bulk produces a heat sufficient to kill the egg; the
      moisture is suffered to remain indeed, but the external air is excluded. A nicer operation
      yet has been attempted; that is, to produce an intermediate temperature of heat between
      that which kills the egg, and that which produces putrefaction. The threshing the
      grain as soon as it is cut, and laying it in its chaff in large heaps, has been found
      very nearly to hit this temperature, though not perfectly, nor always. The heap generates
      heat sufficient to kill most of the eggs, whilst the chaff commonly restrains it from
      rising into putrefaction. But all these methods abridge too much the quantity which
      the farmer can manage, and enable other countries to undersell him which are not infested
      with this insect. There is still a desideratum then to give with us decisive triumph
      to this branch of agriculture over that of tobacco.&#8211;&#8211;The culture of wheat, by enlarging
      our pasture, <span id="page-281" class="pagenum">[ 281 ]</span> will render the Arabian horse <i id="editorial-xw20aab3e1282c11" class="fa fa-info-trigger editorialTrigger"/><span id="xw20aab3e1282c11" class="addEditorial">Perhaps the most prestigious and desired breed of horse at this time.

      climate of America where he may be raised without degeneracy. Southwardly the heat
      of the sun occasions a deficiency of pasture, and northwardly the winters are too
      cold for the short and fine hair, the particular sensibility and constitution of that
      race. Animals transplanted into unfriendly climates, either change their nature and
      acquire new fences against the new difficulties in which they are placed, or they
      multiply poorly and become extinct. A good foundation is laid for their propagation
      here by our possessing already great numbers of horses of that blood, and by a decided
      taste and preference for them established among the people. Their patience of heat
      without injury, their superior wind, fit them better in this and the more southern
      climates even for the drudgeries of the plough and waggon. Northwardly they will become
      an object only to persons of taste and fortunes for the saddle and light carriages.
      To these, and for these uses, their fleetness and beauty will recommend them.&#8211;&#8211;Besides
      these there will be other valuable substitutes when the cultivation of tobacco shall
      be discontinued, such as 
      <span id="page-282" class="pagenum">[ 282 ]</span> cotton in the eastern parts of the state, and hemp and flax in the western.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1284">It is not easy to say what are the articles either of necessity, comfort, or luxury,
      which we cannot raise, and which we therefore shall be under a necessity of importing
      from abroad, as every thing hardier than the olive, and as hardy as the fig, may be
      raised here in the open air. Sugar, coffee and tea, indeed, are not between these
      limits; and habit having placed them among the necessaries of life with the wealthy
      part of our citizens, as long as these habits remain, we must go for them to those
      countries which are able to furnish them.

      it has happened that in this, as well as the other American states the nominal value

    <p>Foot note for p 283</p>
	<p>In the states where the Dollar is valued at 6/. the coincidence of their currency
    with the Greek &amp; Roman monies is so singular as to be worthy notice &amp; to found suspicion
    that this object may have had some influence in fixing our monies at this particular
    point, at a time when the value of Greek &amp; Roman learning was more justly estimated
    than at this day. The Penny lawful is precisely the Roman as, which was their unit,
    10. of which, equal to ten Pence lawful made the Attic Drachma according to Pliny,
    l.21.c.33. in the latter ages of their history the monies of these two people were
    interwoven so as to make parts of the same series, which were in some degree decimal.
    </p>
    The as (L. at first Libralis but latterly ½ an ounce of copper &amp; called Libella) =
    1.<sup>d</sup> lawful.<br />
    10. as made the Denarius (X.) or Attic Drachm= 10.<sup>d</sup> <br />
    100. denarii made the Mina or Pondo = 1000<sup>d</sup> or £4-3-4 <br />
    the denarius having been divide into fourth of 2½ as each, the fourth was called <br />
    a Sestertius or Nummus (LLS. or HS.) = 2½<sup>d</sup> <br />
    100. Sesterces made an Aureus latterly = 250<sup>d</sup> = £1-0-10 <br />
        1000. Sesterces made the Sestertium = £10-8-4 <br />
        the Libra = 96 X. = £4. lawful <br />
        the Talent of Silver = 60 Mina = £250. <br />
        the Talent of Gold was the decuple of the talent of silver at the proportion of 10
        for 1. as among the Romans = £2500. <br />
        and was the Miliary of the Libra if valued at 16. for 1. as among  moderns = 1000.
        Librae = £4000.
        <p>It is understood that the Attic drachm of silver was exactly our Dram Troy of 60.
        gr. the Denarius of the Romans was the 7.<sup>th</sup> part of their Ounce, which is supposed to have been exactly our Avoirdupois ounce,
        but this is of 437½ gr. Troy, which would make the Roman Denarios 62 ½ gr. &amp; consequently</p>
      <span id="page-t-i_23_page_2" class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 23, Page 2 ]</span>
        <p>1/24 more than the Attic drachm, contrary to the testimony of antiquity that the Denarius
        and the Drachm were equal. we may very probably conjecture that our Troy weight is
        taken from the Grecians, from whom our Physicians derive their science &amp;, in copying
        their recipes, would of course preserve their weights which fix the quantum &amp; proportion
        of ingredients. We may as probably affirm that our Avoirdupois weight is taken from
        the Romans, from whom through their colonies &amp; conquests in France, Spain, Germany,
        Britain we derive our Agriculture &amp; Commerce. accordingly we observe that while we
        weight our physic by the Troy or Grecian weights, we use the Avoirdupois or Roman
        for the productions of agriculture &amp; general articles of Commerce. and since Antiquity
        affirms that these two series were united by the equality of the Drachm &amp; Denarius,
        we must conclude that in progress of time, they have become a little separated in
        use with us, to wit 1/24 part as before noted.
        </p>
        <p>But the point at which their separation has been arrested, and fixed is a very remarkable
        one. 1000 ounces avoirdupois make exactly a cubic foot of water. this integral, decimal,
        &amp; cubical relation induces a presumption that while deciding among the varieties &amp;
        uncertainties which, during the ruder ages of the arts, we know had crept into the
        weights &amp; measures of England, they had adopted for their standard those which stood
        so conveniently connected through the medium of a natural element, always at hand
        to be appealed to.
        </p>
        <p>The ounce avoirdupois being this fixed at the thousandth part of a cubic foot of water,
        the Winchester bushel, of 2150.4 cubic inches, filled with water, would weight 77.7
        lb avoirdupois,</p>
      <span id="page-t-i_23_page_3" class="pagenum">[ Tip-in 23, Page 3 ]</span>
</p>
        <p id="xw20aab3e1294">and, filled with wheat of statute quality, weighed 64. lb amidst the varieties discovered
        between the standard weights Avoirdupois &amp; Troy in their different depositories, it
        would be observed that all of them were a little over or under this proportion: &amp;
        this would suffice to give this proportion the preference, and to fix the standard
        relation between the Avoirdupois &amp; Troy pounds at that which nature has established
        between the weights of water and wheat: and the Troy grain, 5760 of which make the
        pound Troy, would be so adjusted as that 7000 of them would make the pound Avoirdupois.
        for 7000:5760::77.7: 64. Exactly the same proportion is known to exist between the
        dry &amp; liquid measures. for the corn gallon contains 272. cubic inches &amp; the antient
        liquid gallon of Guildhall 224. cubic inches. so that the system of weights &amp; measures
        Avoirdupois &amp; Troy, dry &amp; liquid are found to be in the simple relation of the weights
        &amp; measure of the two obvious and natural subjects <i id="xw20aab3e1294b1">water</i> &amp; <i id="xw20aab3e1294b3">wheat</i>. that is to say, the Pound Avoirdupoise:Pound Troy::the weight of water:weight of
        wheat::the bulk of the corn gallon : the bulk of the liquid gallon or 7000:5760::77.7:64::272:224.
        </p>
        <p id="xw20aab3e1296">These weights &amp; measures seem to have been so combined as to render it immaterial
        whether a commodity was dealt out by weight
        or measure. for the dry gallon of wheat, &amp; the liquid one of wine were of the same
        weight, &amp; the Avoirdupois pound of wheat, &amp; the Troy pound of wine were of the same
        measure. a more natural, accurate, &amp; curious reconciliation of the two systems of
        Greece &amp; Rome which happened to be found in use could not have been imagined; &amp; the
        extension of the connection, from weights &amp; measures, to coins, as is done so integrally
        by our Lawful currency, which makes the penny of 6. grains of silver, as was the Roman
        as, has completed the system.

      Kennet, Ainsworth &amp; the Encylopedie; &amp; are as likely to have prevailed with our ancestors
      as the opinions opposed to them."
      <span id="page-283" class="pagenum">[ 283 ]</span> to differ among ourselves too, I am not able to say with certainty. I find that in
      1631 our house of burgesses desired of the privy council in England, a coin debased
      to twenty-five per cent: that in 1645 they forbid dealing by barter for tobacco, and
      established the Spanish piece of eight at six shillings, as the standard of their
      currency: that in 1655 they changed it to five shillings sterling. In 1680 they sent
      an address to the king, in consequence of which, by proclamation in 1683, he fixed
      the value of French Crowns, rixdollars and pieces of eight at six shillings, and the
      coin of New-England at one shilling.  That in 1710, 1714, 1727, and 1762, other regulations
      were made, which will be better presented to the eye stated in the form of a table
      as follows:

   <p id="xw20aab3e1320">The first symptom of the depreciation of our present paper-money, was that of silver
      dollars selling at six shillings, which had before been worth but five shillings and
      ninepence. The assembly thereupon raised them by law to six shillings. As the dollar
      is now likely to become the money-unit of America, as it passes at this rate in some
      of our sister-states, and as it facilitates their computation in pounds and shillings,
      &amp; e converso, this seems to be more convenient than it's former denomination. But
      as this particular coin now stands higher than any other in the proportion of 133&#8531;
      to 125, or 16 to 15, it will be necessary to raise the others in the same proportion.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1326">THE public income and expences?
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1328">The nominal amount of these varying  constantly and rapidly, with the constant and
      rapid depreciation of our paper-money, it becomes impracticable to say what they are.
      We find ourselves cheated in every essay by the depreciation intervening between the
      declaration of the tax and its actual receipt. It will therefore be more satisfactory
      to 
      <span id="page-286" class="pagenum">[ 286 ]</span> consider what our income may be when we shall find means of collecting what the people
      may spare. I should estimate the whole taxable property of this state at an hundred
      millions of dollars, or thirty millions of pounds our money. One per cent on this,
      compared with any thing we ever yet paid, would be deemed a very heavy tax. Yet I
      think that those who manage well, and use reasonable &#339;conomy, could pay one and a
      half per cent, and maintain their houshould comfortably in the mean time, without
      aliening any part of their principal, and that the people would submit to this willingly
      for the purpose of supporting their present contest. We may say then, that we could
      raise, and ought to raise, from one million to one million and a half of dollars annually,
      that is from three hundred to four hundred and fifty thousand pounds, Virginia money.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1330">Of our expences it is equally difficult to give an exact state, and for the same reason.
      They are mostly stated in paper money, which varying continually, the legislature
      endeavours at every session, by new corrections, to adapt the nominal sums to the
      value it is wished they should bear. I will state them therefore in real coin, at
      the point at which they endeavour to keep them.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1336">Dollars, or 53,571 guineas. This estimate is exclusive of the military expence. That
      varies with the force actually employed, and in time of peace will probably be little
      or nothing. It is exclusive also of the public debts, which are growing while I am
      writing, and cannot therefore be now fixed. So it is of the maintenance of the poor,
      which being merely a matter of charity, cannot be deemed expended in the administration
      of government. And if we strike out the 25,000 dollars for the services of the clergy,
      which neither makes part of that administration, more than what is paid to physicians
      or lawyers, and being voluntary, is either much or nothing as every one pleases, it
      leaves 225,000 dollars, equal to 48,208 guineas, the real cost of the apparatus of
      government with us. This, divided among the actual inhabitants of our country, comes
      to about two-fifths of a dollar, 21d sterling, or 42 sols, the price which each pays
      annually for the protection of the residue of his property, that of his person, and
      the other advantages of a free government. The public revenues of Great Britain divided
      in like manner on <span id="page-289" class="pagenum">[ 289 ]</span> its inhabitants would be sixteen times greater. Deducting even the double of the
      expences of government, as before estimated, from the million and a half of dollars
      which we before supposed might be annually paid without distress, we may conclude
      that this state can contribute one million of dollars annually towards supporting
      the federal army, paying the federal debt, building a federal navy, or opening roads,
      clearing rivers, forming safe ports, and other useful works.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1338">To this estimate of our abilities, let me add a word as to the application of them,
      if, when cleared of the present contest, and of the debts with which that will charge
      us, we come to measure force hereafter with any European power. Such events are devoutly
      to be deprecated. Young as we are, and with such a country before us to fill with
      people and with happiness, we should point in that direction the whole generative
      force of nature, wasting none of it in efforts of mutual destruction. It should be
      our endeavour to cultivate the peace and friendship of every nation, even of that
      which has injured us most, when we shall have carried our point against her. Our interest
      will be to throw open the doors of commerce, and to knock off all its shackles, giving
      perfect freedom to all persons for the vent of <span id="page-290" class="pagenum">[ 290 ]</span> whatever they may chuse to bring into our ports, and asking the same in theirs. Never
      was so much false arithmetic employed on any subject, as that which has been employed
      to persuade nations that it is their interest to go to war. Were the money which it
      has cost to gain, at the close of a long war, a little town, or a little territory,
      the right to cut wood here, or to catch fish there, expended in improving what they
      already possess, in making roads, opening rivers, building ports, improving the arts,
      and finding employment for their idle poor, it would render them much stronger, much
      wealthier and happier. This I hope will be our wisdom. And, perhaps, to remove as
      much as possible the occasions of making war, it might be better for us to abandon
      the ocean altogether, that being the element whereon we shall be principally exposed
      to jostle with other nations: to leave to others to bring what we shall want, and
      to carry what we can spare. This would make us invulnerable to Europe, by offering
      none of our property to their prize, and would turn all our citizens to the cultivation
      of the earth; and, I repeat it again, cultivators of the earth are the most virtuous
      and independant citizens. It might be time enough seek employment for them at sea,
      when the land no longer offers it. But the actual <span id="page-291" class="pagenum">[ 291 ]</span> habits of our countrymen attach them to commerce. They will exercise it for themselves.
      Wars then must sometimes be our lot; and all the wise can do, will be to avoid that
      half of them which would be produced by our own follies, and our own acts of injustice;
      and to make for the other half the best preparations we can.  Of what nature should
      these be? A land army would be useless for offence, and not the best nor safest instrument
      of defence. For either of these purposes, the sea is the field on which we should
      meet an European enemy. On that element it is necessary we should possess some power.
      To aim at such a navy as the greater nations of Europe possess, would be a foolish
      and wicked waste of the energies of our countrymen. It would be to pull on our own
      heads that load of military expence, which makes the European labourer go supperless
      to bed, and moistens his bread with the sweat of his brows. It will be enough if we
      enable ourselves to prevent insults from those nations of Europe which are weak on
      the sea, because circumstances exist, which render even the stronger ones weak as
      to us. Providence has placed their richest and most defenceless possessions at our
      door; has obliged their most precious commerce to pass as it were in review before
      us. To protect this, or to <span id="page-292" class="pagenum">[ 292 ]</span> assail us, a small part only of their naval force will ever be risqued across the
      Atlantic. The dangers to which the elements expose them here are too well known, and
      the greater dangers to which they would be exposed at home, were any general calamity
      to involve their whole fleet. They can attack us by detachment only; and it will suffice
      to make ourselves equal to what they may detach. Even a smaller force than they may
      detach will be rendered equal or superior by the quickness with which any check may
      be repaired with us, while losses with them will be irreparable till too late. A small
      naval force then is sufficient for us, and a small one is necessary. What this should
      be, I will not undertake to say. I will only say, it should by no means be so great
      as we are able to make it. Suppose the million of dollars, or 300,000 pounds, which
      Virginia could annually spare without distress, to be applied to the creating a navy.
      A single year's contribution would build, equip, man, and send to sea a force which
      should carry 300 guns. The rest of the confederacy, exerting themselves in the same
      proportion, would equip in the same time 1500 guns more. So that one year's contributions
      would set up a navy of 1800 guns. The British ships of the line average 76 <span id="page-293" class="pagenum">[ 293 ]</span> guns; their frigates 38. 1800 guns then would form a fleet of 30 ships, 18 of which
      might be of the line, and 12 frigates. Allowing 8 men, the British average, for every
      gun, their annual expence, including subsistence, cloathing, pay, and ordinary repairs,
      would be about 1280 dollars for every gun, or 2,304,000 dollars for the whole. I state
      this only as one year's possible exertion, without deciding whether more or less than
      a year's exertion should be thus applied.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1340">The value of our lands and slaves, taken conjunctly, doubles in about twenty years.
      This arises from the multiplication of our slaves, from the extension of culture,
      and increased demand for lands. The amount of what may be raised will of course rise
      in the same proportion.

         The "Pistole Fee" controversy that followed, in which the Virginia legislature argued
         that the colonial administration had no right to impose such taxes on its own authority,

      the resolutions of the house of burgesses of 1765 were passed, declaring the independance
      of the people of Virginia on the parliament of Great-Britain, in matters of taxation.
      From that time till the declaration of independance by congress in 1776, their journals

      of Congress, he has furnished me with the following observations, which have too much
      merit not to be communicated.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1531">(I.) p. 24. Besides the three channels of communication mentioned between the western
      waters and the Atlantic, there are two others, to which the Pennsylvanians are turning
      their attention; one from Presque-isle, on Lake Erié, to Le Boeuf, down the Alleghaney
      to Kiskiminitas, then up the Kiskiminitas, and from thence, by a small portage, to
      Juniata, which falls into the Susquehanna: the other from Lake Ontario to the East
      Branch of the Delaware, and down that to Philadelphia. Both these are said to be very
      practicable: and, considering the enterprising temper of the Pennsylvanians, and particularly
      of the merchants of Philadelphia, whose object is concentered in promoting the commerce
      and trade of one city, it is not <span id="page-334" class="pagenum">[ 334 ]</span> improbable but one or both of these communications will be opened and improved.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1533">(2.) p. 28. The reflections I was led into on viewing this passage of the Patowmac
      through the Blue ridge were, that this country must have suffered some violent convulsion,
      and that the face of it must have been changed from what it probably was some centuries
      ago: that the broken and ragged faces of the mountain on each side the river; the
      tremendous rocks, which are left with one end fixed in the precipice, and the other
      jutting out, and seemingly ready to fall for want of support; the bed of the river
      for several miles below obstructed, and filled with the loose stones carried from
      this mound; in short, every thing on which you cast your eye evidently demonstrates
      a disrupture and breach in the mountain, and that, before this happened, what is now
      a fruitful vale, was formerly a great lake or collection of water, which possibly
      might have here formed a mighty cascade, or had its vent to the ocean by the Susquehanna,
      where the Blue ridge seems to terminate. Besides this, there are other parts of this
      country which bear evident traces of a like convulsion. From the best accounts I have
      been able to obtain, the place where the Delaware now flows <span id="page-335" class="pagenum">[ 335 ]</span> through the Kittatinny mountain, which is a continuation of what is called the North
      ridge, or mountain, was not its original course, but that it passed through what is
      now called 'the Wind-gap,' a place several miles to the westward, and above an hundred
      feet higher than the present bed of the river. This Wind-gap is about a mile broad,
      and the stones in it such as seem to have been washed for ages by water running over
      them. Should this have been the case, there must have been a large lake behind that
      mountain, and by some uncommon swell in the waters, or by some convulsion of nature,
      the river must have opened its way through a different part of the mountain, and meeting
      there with less obstruction, carried away with it the opposing mounds of earth, and
      deluged the country below with the immense collection of waters to which this new
      passage gave vent. There are still remaining, and daily discovered, innumerable instances
      of such a deluge on both sides of the river, after it passed the hills above the falls
      of Trenton, and reached the champaign. On the New-Jersey side, which is flatter than
      the Pennsylvania side, all the country below Croswick hills seems to have been overflowed
      to the distance of from ten to fifteen miles back from the river, and to have acquired
      a new <span id="page-336" class="pagenum">[ 336 ]</span> soil by the earth and clay brought down and mixed with the native sand. The spot
      on which Philadelphia stands evidently appears to be made ground. The different strata
      through which they pass in digging to water, the acorns, leaves, and sometimes branches,
      which are found above twenty feet below the surface, all seem to demonstrate this.
      I am informed that at York town in Virginia, in the bank of York river, there are
      different strata of shells and earth, one above another, which seem to point out that
      the country there has undergone several changes; that the sea has, for a succession
      of ages, occupied the place where dry land now appears; and that the ground has been
      suddenly raised at various periods. What a change would it make in the country below,
      should the mountains at Niagara, by any accident, be cleft asunder, and a passage
      suddenly opened to drain off the waters of Erié and the Upper lakes! While ruminating
      on these subjects, I have often been hurried away by fancy, and led to imagine, that
      what is now the bay of Mexico, was once a champaign country; and that from the point
      or cape of Florida, there was a continued range of mountains through Cuba, Hispaniola,
      Porto rico, Martinique, Guadaloupe, Barbadoes, and Trinidad, till it reached the coast
      <span id="page-337" class="pagenum">[ 337 ]</span> of America, and formed the shores which bounded the ocean, and guarded the country
      behind: that, by some convulsion or shock of nature, the sea had broken through these
      mounds, and deluged that vast plain, till it reached the foot of the Andes; that being
      there heaped up by the trade-winds, always blowing from one quarter, it had found
      its way back, as it continues to do, through the gulph between Florida and Cuba, carrying
      with it the loom and sand it may have scooped from the country it had occupied, part
      of which it may have deposited on the shores of North America, and with part formed
      the banks of Newfoundland.&#8212;But these are only the visions of fancy.

      quality. The late Dr. Bond informed me, that he had under his care a patient, a young
      girl, who had put the seeds of this plant into her eye, which dilated the pupil to
      such a degree, that she could see in the dark, but in the light was almost blind.
      The effect that the leaves had when eaten by a ship's crew that arrived at James town,
      are well known &#8224;.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1543">[4.] p. 107. Mons. Buffon has indeed given an afflicting picture of human nature in
      his description of the man of America. But sure I am there never was a picture more
      unlike the original. He grants indeed that his stature is the same as that of the
      man of Europe. He might have admitted, that the Iroquois were larger, and the Lenopi,
      or Delawares, taller than people in Europe generally are. But he says their organs
      of generation are smaller and weaker than those of Europeans. Is this a fact? I believe
      not; at least it is an observation I never heard before.&#8212; 'They have no beard.' Had
      he known the pains and trouble it costs the men to pluck out by the roots the hair
      that grows on their faces, he would have seen that nature had not been deficient in
      that respect. Every nation has its customs. I have seen an Indian beau, with a looking-glass
      in his hand, examining his face for hours together, and plucking out by the roots
      every hair he could discover, with a kind of tweezer made of a piece of fine brass
      wire, that had been twisted round a stick, and which he used with great dexterity.&#8212;
      'They have no ardour for their female.' It is true, they do not indulge those excesses,
      nor discover that fondness which is customary in Europe; but this is not owing to
      a defect in nature, 
      <span id="page-339" class="pagenum">[ 339 ]</span> but to manners. Their soul is wholly bent upon war. This is what procures them glory
      among the men, and makes them the admiration of the women. To this they are educated
      from their earliest youth. When they pursue game with ardour, when they bear the fatigues
      of the chase, when they sustain and suffer patiently hunger and cold; it is not so
      much for the sake of the game they pursue, as to convince their parents and the council
      of the nation that they are fit to be enrolled in the number of the warriors. The
      songs of the women, the dance of the warriors, the sage counsel of the chiefs, the
      tales of the old, the triumphal entry of the warriors returning with success from
      battle, and the respect paid to those who distinguish themselves in war and in subduing
      their enemies; in short, every thing they see or hear tends to inspire them with an
      ardent desire for military fame. If a young man were to discover a fondness for women
      before he has been to war, he would become the contempt of the men, and the scorn
      and ridicule of the women. Or were he to indulge himself with a captive taken in war,
      and much more were he to offer violence in order to gratify his lust, he would incur
      indelible disgrace. The seeming frigidity of the men, therefore, is the effect of
      manners, and not a defect of 
      <span id="page-340" class="pagenum">[ 340 ]</span> nature. Besides, a celebrated warrior is oftener courted by the females, than he
      has occasion to court: and this is a point of honour which the men aim at. Instances
      similar to that of * Ruth and Boaz are not uncommon among them. For though the women
      are modest and diffident, and so bashful that they seldom lift up their eyes, and
      scarce ever look a man full in the face, yet, being brought up in great subjection,
      custom and manners reconcile them to modes of acting, which, judged of by Europeans,
      would be deemed inconsistent with the rules of female decorum and propriety. I once
      saw a young widow, whose husband, a warrior, had died about eight days before, hastening
      to finish her grief, and who by tearing her hair, beating her breast, and drinking
      spirits, made the tears flow in great abundance, in order that she might grieve much
      in a short space of time, and be married that evening to another young warrior. The
      manner in which this was viewed by the men and women of the tribe, who stood round,
      silent and solemn spectators of the scene, and the indifference with which they answered
      my 
      <span id="xw20aab3e1543b5" class="authorNote">* When Boaz had eaten and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the
         end of the heap of corn: and Ruth came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her
         down. Ruth iii. 7.</span>
      <span id="page-341" class="pagenum">[ 341 ]</span>  question respecting it, convinced me that it was no unusual custom. I have known
      men advanced in years, whose wives were old and past child-bearing, take young wives,
      and have children, though the practice of polygamy is not common. Does this savour
      of frigidity, or want of ardour for the female? Neither do they seem to be deficient
      in natural affection. I have seen both fathers and mothers in the deepest affliction,
      when their children have been dangerously ill; though I believe the affection is stronger
      in the descending than the ascending scale, and though custom forbids a father to
      grieve immoderately for a son slain in battle.&#8212; 'That they are timorous and cowardly,'
      is a character with which there is little reason to charge them, when we recollect
      the manner in which the Iroquois met Mons. &#8212;&#8212;, who marched into their country; in
      which the old men, who scorned to fly, or to survive the capture of their town, braved
      death, like the old Romans in the time of the Gauls, and in which they soon after
      revenged themselves by sacking and destroying Montreal. But above all, the unshaken
      fortitude with which they bear the most excruciating tortures and death when taken
      prisoners, ought to exempt them from that character. Much less are they to be characterised
      as a people of <span id="page-342" class="pagenum">[ 342 ]</span> no vivacity, and who are excited to action or motion only by the calls of hunger
      and thirst. Their dances in which they so much delight, and which to a European would
      be the most severe exercise, fully contradict this, not to mention their fatiguing
      marches, and the toil they voluntarily and cheerfully undergo in their military expeditions.
      It is true, that when at home, they do not employ themselves in labour or the culture
      of the soil: but this again is the effect of customs and manners, which have assigned
      that to the province of the women. But it is said, they are averse to society and
      a social life. Can any thing be more inapplicable than this to a people who always
      live in towns or clans? Or can they be said to have no 'republique,' who conduct all
      their affairs in national councils, who pride themselves in their national character,
      who consider an insult or injury done to an individual by a stranger as done to the
      whole, and resent it accordingly? In short, this picture is not applicable to any
      nation of Indians I have ever known or heard of in North America.

   <p id="xw20aab3e1545">[5.] pa. 156. As far as I have been able to learn, the country from the sea coast
      to the Alleghaney, and from the most southern 
      <span id="page-343" class="pagenum">[ 343 ]</span> waters of James river up to Patuxent river, now in the state of Maryland, was occupied
      by three different nations of Indians, each of which spoke a different language, and
      were under separate and distinct governments. What the original or real names of those
      nations were, I have not been able to learn with certainty: but by us they are distinguished
      by the names of Powhatàns, Mannahòacs, and Mònacans, now commonly called Tuscaròras.
      The Powhatàns, who occupied the country from the sea shore up to the falls of the
      rivers, were a powerful nation, and seem to have consisted of seven tribes five on
      the western and two on the eastern shore. Each of these tribes was subdivided into
      towns, families, or clans, who lived together. All the nations of Indians in North
      America lived in the hunter state, and depended for subsistence on hunting, fishing,
      and the spontaneous fruits of the earth, and a kind of grain which was planted and
      gathered by the women, and is now known by the name of Indian corn. Long potatoes,
      pumpkins of various kinds, and squashes, were also found in use among them. They had
      no flocks, herds, or tamed animals of any kind. Their government is a kind of patriarchal
      confederacy. Every town or family has a chief, who is distinguished by 
      <span id="page-344" class="pagenum">[ 344 ]</span> a particular title, and whom we commonly call 'Sachem.' The several towns or families
      that compose a tribe, have a chief who presides over it, and the several tribes composing
      a nation have a chief who presides over the whole nation. These chiefs are generally
      men advanced in years, and distinguished by their prudence and abilities in council.
      The matters which merely regard a town or family are settled by the chief and principal
      men of the town: those which regard a tribe, such as the appointment of head warriors
      or captains, and settling differences between different towns and families, are regulated
      at a meeting or council of the chiefs from the several towns; and those which regard
      the whole nation, such as the making war, concluding peace, or forming alliances with
      the neighbouring nations, are deliberated on and determined in a national council
      composed of the chiefs of the tribe, attended by the head warriors and a number of
      the chiefs from the towns, who are his counsellors. In every town there is a council
      house, where the chief and old men of the town assemble, when occasion requires, and
      consult what is proper to be done. Every tribe has a fixed place for the chiefs of
      the towns to meet and consult on the business of the tribe: and in every 
      <span id="page-345" class="pagenum">[ 345 ]</span> nation there is what they call the central council house, or central council fire,
      where the chiefs of the several tribes, with the principal warriors, convene to consult
      and determine on their national affairs. When any matter is proposed in the national
      council, it is common for the chiefs of the several tribes to consult thereon apart
      with their counsellors, and, when they have agreed, to deliver the opinion of the
      tribe at the national council: and, as their government seems to rest wholly on persuasion,
      they endeavour, by mutual concessions, to obtain unanimity. Such is the government
      that still subsists among the Indian nations bordering upon the United States. Some
      historians seem to think, that the dignity of office of Sachem was hereditary. But
      that opinion does not appear to be well founded. The Sachem or chief of the tribe
      seems to be by election. And sometimes persons who are strangers, and adopted into
      the tribe, are promoted to this dignity, on account of their abilities. Thus on the
      arrival of Capt. Smith, the first founder of the colony of Virginia, Opechàncanough,
      who was Sachem or chief of the Chickahòminies, one of the tribes of the Powhàtans,
      is said to have been of another tribe, and even of another nation, so that no certain
      <span id="page-346" class="pagenum">[ 346 ]</span> account could be obtained of his origin or descent. The chiefs of the nation seem
      to have been by a rotation among the tribes. Thus when Capt. Smith, in the year 1609,
      questioned Powhàtan (who was the chief of the nation, and whose proper name is said
      to have been Wahunsonacock) respecting the succession, the old chief informed him,
      'that he was very old and had seen the death of all his people thrice* ; that not
      one of these generations were then living except himself, that he must soon die and
      the succession descend in order to his brothers Opichapàn, Opechàncanough, and Catatàugh,
      and then to his two sisters, and their two daughters. But these were appellations
      designating the tribes in the confederacy. For the persons named are not his real
      brothers, but the chiefs of different

      after his decease Opechàncanough became chief of the nation. I need only mention another
      instance to shew that the chiefs of the tribes claimed this kindred with the head
      of the nation. In 1622, when Raleigh Crashaw was with Japazàw, the Sachem or chief
      of the Patowmacs, Opechàncanough, who had great power and influence, being the second
      man in the nation, and next in succession to Opichapan, and who was a bitter but secret
      enemy to the English, and wanted to engage his nation in a war with them, sent two
      baskets of beads to the Patowmac chief, and desired him to kill the Englishman that
      was with him. Japazaw replied, that the English were his friends, and Opichapàn his
      <i id="xw20aab3e1545c13">brother</i>, and that therefore there should be no blood shed between them by his means. It is
      also to be observed, that when the English first came over, in all their conferences
      with any of the chiefs, they constantly heard him make mention of his <i id="xw20aab3e1545c15">brother</i>, with whom he must consult, or to whom he referred them, meaning thereby either the
      chief of the nation, or the tribes in confederacy. The Manahòacks are said to have
      been a confederacy of four tribes, and in alliance with the Monacans, in the
      <span id="page-348" class="pagenum">[ 348 ]</span> war which they were carrying on against the Powhatans.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1547">To the northward of these there was another powerful nation, which occupied the country
      from the head of the Chesapeak-bay up to the Kittatinney mountain, and as far eastward
      as Connecticut river, comprehending that part of New-York which lies between the highlands
      and the ocean, all the state of New-Jersey, that part of Pennsylvania which is watered,
      below the range of the Kittatinney mountains, by the rivers or streams falling into
      the Delaware, and the county of Newcastle in the state of Delaware, as far as Duck
      creek. It is to be observed, that the nations of Indians distinguished their countries
      one from another by natural boundaries, such as ranges of mountains, or streams of
      water. But as the heads of rivers frequently interlock, or approach near to each other,
      as those who live upon a stream claim the country watered by it, they often encroached
      on each other, and this is a constant source of war between the different nations.
      The nation occupying the tract of country last described, called themselves Lenopi.
      The French writers call them Loups; and among the English they are now commonly called
      Delawares. This nation or confederacy consisted of five tribes, <span id="page-349" class="pagenum">[ 349 ]</span> who all spoke one language. 1. The Chihohocki, who dwelt on the West side of the
      river now called Delaware, a name which it took from Lord De la War, who put into
      it on his passage from Virginia in the year , but which by the Indians was called Chihohocki. 2. The Wanami, who inhabited the
      country, called New-Jersey, from the Rariton to the sea. 3. The Munsey, who dwelt
      on the upper streams of the Delaware, from the Kittatinney mountains down to the Leheigh
      or western branch of the Delaware. 4. The Wabinga, who are sometimes called River
      Indians, sometimes Mohickanders, and who had their dwelling between the west branch
      of Delaware and Hudson's river, from the Kittatinney ridge down to the Rariton: and
      5. The Mahiccon, or Mahattan, who occupied Staten island, York island, (which from
      its being the principal seat of their residence was formerly called Mahatton) Long
      island, and that part of New-York and Connecticut which lies between Hudson and Connecticut
      rivers, from the highland, which is a continuation of the Kittatinney ridge down to
      the sound. This nation had a close alliance with the Shawanese, who lived on the Susquehannah
      and to the westward of that river, as far as the Alleghaney mountains, and carried
      on a 
      <span id="page-350" class="pagenum">[ 350 ]</span> long war with another powerful nation or confederacy of Indians, which lived to the
      north of them between the Kittatinney mountains, or highlands, and the lake Ontario,
      and who call themselves Mingos, and are called by the French writers Iroquois, by
      the English the Five Nations, and by the Indians to the southward, with whom they
      were at war, Massawomacs. This war  was carrying on, in its greatest fury, when Captain
      Smith first arrived in Virginia. The Mingo warriors had penetrated down the Susquehanna
      to the mouth of it. In one of his excursions up the bay, at the mouth of Susquehanna,
      in 1608, Captain Smith met with six or seven of their canoes full of warriors, who
      were coming to attack their enemies in the rear. In an excursion which he had made
      a few weeks before, up the Rappahanock, and in which he had a skirmish with a party
      of the Manahoacs, and taken a brother of one of their chiefs prisoner, he first heard
      of this nation. For when he asked the prisoner, why his nation attacked the English?
      the prisoner said, because his nation had heard that the English came from under the
      world to take their world from them. Being asked, how many worlds he knew? he said,
      he knew but one, which was under the sky that covered him, <span id="page-351" class="pagenum">[ 351 ]</span> and which consisted of the Powhatàns, the Mànakins, and the Massawòmacs. Being questioned
      concerning the latter, he said, they dwelt on a great water to the North, that they
      had many boats, and so many men that they waged war with all the rest of the world.
      The Mingo confederacy then consisted of five tribes; three who are called the elder,
      to wit, the Senecas, who live to the West, the Mohawks to the East, and the Onondagas
      between them; and two who are called the younger tribes, namely, the Cayugas, and
      Oneidas. All these tribes speak one language, and were then united in a close confederacy,
      and occupied the tract  of country from the East end of lake Erié to lake Champlain,
      and from the Kittatinney and Highlands to the lake Ontario and the river Cadaraqui,
      or St. Laurence. They had, some time before that, carried on a war with a nation,
      who lived beyond the lakes, and were called Adirondacs. In this war they were worsted:
      but having made a peace with them, through the intercession of the French, who were
      then settling Canada, they turned their arms against the Lenopi; and as this war was
      long and doubtful, they, in the course of it, not only exerted their whole force,
      but put in practice every measure which prudence or policy 
      <span id="page-352" class="pagenum">[ 352 ]</span> could devise to bring it to a successful issue. For this purpose they bent their
      course down the Susquehanna, warring with the Indians in their way, and having penetrated
      as far as the mouth of it, they, by the terror of their arms, engaged a nation, now
      known by the name of Nanticocks, Conoys, and Tùteloes, and who lived between Chesapeak
      and Delaware bays, and bordering on the tribe of Chihohocki, to enter into an alliance
      with them. They also formed an alliance with the Monakans, and stimulated them to
      a war with the Lenopi and their confederates. At the same time the Mohawks carried
      on a furious war down the Hudson against the Mohiccons and River indians, and compelled
      them to purchase a temporary and precarious peace, by acknowledging them to be their
      superiors, and paying an annual tribute. The Lenopi being surrounded with enemies,
      and hard pressed, and having lost many of their warriors, were at last compelled to
      sue for peace, which was granted to them on the condition that they should put themselves
      under the protection of the Mingoes, confine themselves to raising corn, hunting for
      the subsistence of their families, and no longer have the power of making war. This
      is what the Indians call making them women. And in 
      <span id="page-353" class="pagenum">[ 353 ]</span> this condition the Lenopis were when William Penn first arrived and began the settlement
      of Pennsylvania in 1682.
   </p>
   <p id="xw20aab3e1549">[6.] Pa. 162. From the figurative language of the Indians, as well as from the practice
      of those we are still acquainted with, it is evident that it was, and still continues
      to be, a constant custom among the Indians to gather up the bones of the dead, and
      deposit them in a particular place. Thus, when they make peace with any nation, with
      whom they have been at war, after burying the hatchet, they take up the belt of wampum,
      and say, 'We now gather up all the bones of those who have been slain, and  bury them,
      &amp;c.' See all the treaties of peace. Besides, it is customary when any of them die
      at a distance from home, to bury them, and afterwards to come and take up the bones,
      and carry them home. At a treaty which was held at Lancaster with the six nations,
      one of them died, and was buried in the woods a little distance from the town. Some
      time after a party came and cook up the body, separated the flesh from the bones by
      boiling and scraping them clean, and carried them to be deposited in the sepulchres
      of their ancestors. The operation was so offensive and disagreeable, that 
      <span id="page-354" class="pagenum">[ 354 ]</span> nobody could come near them while they were performing it.

      commonly called, Caghnewàgos, are of the Mingo or Six-nation Indians, who, by the
      influence of the French missionaries, have been separated from their nation, and induced
      to settle there.

      But all accounts seem to agree in this, that there is a very powerful nation distinguished
      by a variety of names taken from the several towns or families, but commonly called
      Tàwas or Outawas, who speak one language, and live round and on the waters that fall
      into the western lakes, and extend from the waters of the Ohio quite to the waters

      of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves
      but fallible and uninspired men have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting
      up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as
      such endeavouring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false
      religions <span id="page-380" class="pagenum">[ 380 ]</span> over the greatest part of the world, and through all time; That to compel a man to
      furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves,
      is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher
      of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving
      his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern,
      and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is withdrawing from
      the ministry those temporal rewards, which, proceeding from an approbation of their
      personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labours
      for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious
      opinions, more than on our opinions in physics or geometry; that therefore the proscribing
      any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of
      being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this
      or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages
      to which in common with his fellow citizens he has a natural right; that it tends
      also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to <span id="page-381" class="pagenum">[ 381 ]</span> encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honors and emoluments, those who
      will externally profess and conform to it; that though indeed these are criminal who
      do not withstand such temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait
      in their way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field
      of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles, on supposition
      of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious
      liberty, because he being of course judge of that tendency, will make his opinions
      the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they
      shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful
      purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out
      into overt acts against peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great and
      will prevail if left to herself, that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist
      to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition
      disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceasing to be dangerous
      when it is permitted freely to contradict them.
