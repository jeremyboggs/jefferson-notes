      <div id="xw20aab3d306b6" class="addDescription"> A difficult page to transcribe. Something has been lightly pencilled in the left
         margin and rubbed away: "one [in?] W..s.[m?].g ..l en... of.. l.[k?]. Fl[e?]mi[ng?].
         Be au... .i.t." The two &#8251; marks (known as "asteriskos"), are in pencil and traditionally
         signal to a printer to switch one line with another. The reference to Samuel Pleasants
         Junior's <i id="xw20aab3d306b6b1">Virginia Argus</i> is written between the paragraphs and disappears into the binding, making it impossible
         to transcribe the manuscript addition beyond the first two numerals "10" and the "t"
         ("broke out 10[0 feet] higher up t[he] hill."). We follow the printing of the 1853
         edition and interpolate "0 feet" and "he".</div>
