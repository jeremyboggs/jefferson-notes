               <p id="xw20aab3e1292c15b1aa" class="first">and, filled with wheat of statute quality, weighed 64. lb amidst the varieties discovered
                  between the standard weights Avoirdupois &amp; Troy in their different depositories, it
                  would be observed that all of them were a little over or under this proportion: &amp;
                  this would suffice to give this proportion the preference, and to fix the standard
                  relation between the Avoirdupois &amp; Troy pounds at that which nature has established
                  between the weights of water and wheat: and the Troy grain, 5760 of which make the
                  pound Troy, would be so adjusted as that 7000 of them would make the pound Avoirdupois.
                  for 7000:5760::77.7: 64. Exactly the same proportion is known to exist between the
                  dry &amp; liquid measures. for the corn gallon contains 272. cubic inches &amp; the antient
                  liquid gallon of Guildhall 224. cubic inches. so that the system of weights &amp; measures
                  Avoirdupois &amp; Troy, dry &amp; liquid are found to be in the simple relation of the weights
                  &amp; measure of the two obvious and natural subjects <i id="xw20aab3e1292c15b1aab1">water</i> &amp; <i id="xw20aab3e1292c15b1aab3">wheat</i>. that is to say, the Pound Avoirdupoise:Pound Troy::the weight of water:weight of
                  wheat::the bulk of the corn gallon : the bulk of the liquid gallon or 7000:5760::77.7:64::272:224.
               </p>
               <p id="xw20aab3e1292c15b1ab2">These weights &amp; measures seem to have been so combined as to render it immaterial
                  whether a commodity was dealt out by weight
                  or measure. for the dry gallon of wheat, &amp; the liquid one of wine were of the same
                  weight, &amp; the Avoirdupois pound of wheat, &amp; the Troy pound of wine were of the same
                  measure. a more natural, accurate, &amp; curious reconciliation of the two systems of
                  Greece &amp; Rome which happened to be found in use could not have been imagined; &amp; the
                  extension of the connection, from weights &amp; measures, to coins, as is done so integrally
                  by our Lawful currency, which makes the penny of 6. grains of silver, as was the Roman
                  as, has completed the system.
