      <div id="xw20aab3d684c12" class="addDescription"> An <em>e</em> has been added, in ink, correcting an error at the end of the first line. The
         pencilled plus signs appear twice, linking a printed margin note ("Kalm II. 340.")
         to an in-text reference. The + mark in the text appears after "distinct from these".
         Jefferson's manuscript addition, in ink, appears at the bottom of the page, appended
         to the end of the long footnote, which continues from the previous page. The addition
         follows the lineation, its final words squeezed between the text and the printed catchword.</div>
