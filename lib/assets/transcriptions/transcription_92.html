            seems to be nearer the hare than our whabus. the meat is black &amp; an individual weighed
            39Â½ oz. avoird. while the whabus is an animal of white meat &amp; weighs about 29 oz.
            the fur of the former is white as is the case of most animals in countries abounding
            with snow.

   <div id="xw20aab3d652" class="addDescription">The first plus sign appears before the table entry for "Lievre. Hare" in the table
      for Europe. The two plus signs are in pencil; the manuscript addition, which appears
      in the bottom margin below the table, is in ink. The phrase "&amp; mountainous" appears
      above the baseline, inserted with a caret. A word in the second to last line has been
      scratched out. This note is included in the 1853 edition, page 52. "Whabus" is the
      Algonquin name for hare. </div>
