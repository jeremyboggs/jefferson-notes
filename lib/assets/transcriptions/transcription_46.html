         <li id="xw20aab3d186b1b1">Note. this description was written after a lapse of several years from the time of
            my visit to the bridge, and under an error of recollection which requires apology.
            for it is from the bridge itself that the mountains are visible both ways, and not
            from the bottom of the fissure, as my impression then was. the statement therefore
            in the former edition needs the corrections here given to it. Aug. 16. 1817.
