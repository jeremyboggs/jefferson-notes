         <p id="xw20aab3d200b6a" class="first">The cancellation continues from the previous page as a strike-through in pencil. A
            cross-out (2), in pencil, cancels twelve more lines, ending and bracketed at "about
            five miles" in the printed text. A pencilled loop next to the bracket appears in the
            gutter but is not visible in the scan. A caret in text, described above, marks a point
            of insertion for the pasted-in correction. In the left margin, in pencil, appears
            the instruction "to follow the above note." The note itself, in ink, is written in
            the bottom margin below the asterisked and printed footnote on Don Ulloa. The manuscript
            addition is preceded by a pencilled plus.

            Schele de Vere as follows: "Another is mentioned by Clavigero: 'The <i id="xw20aab3d200b6b2b1">Bridge of God</i>; thus they call a vast mass of earth above the deep river Atoyaque, near the village
            of Moleaxac, about a hundred miles from Mexico, in the direction of Scirocco, over
            which carts and carriages pass without difficulty. It might be taken for a fragment
            of the adjacent mountain, torn from it, in times of old, by an earthquake.'&#8212;History
            of Mexico, L. 1, ยง3." Clavigero's text, originally written in Spanish, was published
            in Italian.
