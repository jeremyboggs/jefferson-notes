                  that it is also the immediate cause, or primum mobile of life. for, entering by respiration
                  into the air cells of the lungs, divided from those of the blood but by a thin membrane,
                  it infuses thro' that a stimulus into the blood, which, acting on the irritable fibres
                  of the heart, excites mechanically the action and reaction of that muscle. by these
                  the blood is propelled, and received again in a course of constant circulation and
                  vital action communicated and maintained thro' all the system. intercept vital air
                  from the lungs, the action of the heart ceases for want of stimulus, the current of
                  the blood, unaided, yields to the resistance of it's channels, all the vital motions
                  are suspended, &amp; body becomes an inanimated lump of matter.
