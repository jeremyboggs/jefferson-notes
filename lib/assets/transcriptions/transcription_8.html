      <p id="xw20aab3b5b1">The two manuscript additions are in pencil. A plus sign in the text follows "among
         us." In the bottom margin the name "Barbé Marbois" appears, referring to François
         Barbé-Marbois (1745-1837), the secretary of the French legation whose questionnaire
         prompted Jefferson to begin work on the earliest draft of the <i id="xw20aab3b5b1b1">Notes</i>.
      </p> 
      <p id="xw20aab3b5b3">Over 150 pencil marks appear throughout Jefferson's personal copy. These marks and
         others like them were not made by Jefferson but by one or more people involved in
         the publication of a posthumous edition of the <i id="xw20aab3b5b3b1">Notes</i>, printed in 1853 by Charles H. Wynne for Joseph Williamson Randolph in Richmond.
         The 1853 edition was the first to include the additions and revisions recorded in
         Jefferson's personal copy. The pencil marks guide the typesetting of the new edition
         by indicating how to incorporate Jefferson's manuscript additions. Jefferson's personal
         copy therefore records its author's revisions but also offers evidence of how a printer
         in nineteenth-century America might edit a text to accommodate author intent.
