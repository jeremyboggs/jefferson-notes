      <div id="xw20aab3d698b4" class="addDescription"> A plus sign in pencil appears above Jefferson's margin note "1 Clavigero. 120." The
         corresponding plus mark appears in the text after "introduced among them." At the
         end of Logan's speech a &#8853; mark appears in pencil. The corresponding mark at the bottom
         of the page refers to the letter of J.B. Gibson in the fourth Appendix printed in
         the 1853 edition. The Gibson letter belongs to a controversy over the authenticity
         of Logan's speech. After a letter challenging the accuracy of the Logan's narrative
         by a son-in-law of Cresap named Luther Martin was published in a Baltimore paper on
         March 29, 1797, Jefferson began collecting evidence to certify that the speech was
         not a forgery. Jefferson  published a number of these letters and depositions in 1800
         in a quarto volume titled <i id="xw20aab3d698b4b1">An Appendix to the Notes on Virginia Relative to the Murder of Logan's Family</i> (Philadephia: Samuel H. Smith, 1800). Much of this documentary evidence was reprinted
         in a lengthy appendix to the 1853 edition of the <i id="xw20aab3d698b4b3">Notes</i>, "Relative to the Murder of Logan's Family," which includes a letter of response
         from Jefferson, the certificates and depositions, and a historical statement on the
         affair.</div>
