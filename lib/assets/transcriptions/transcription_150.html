         <p id="xw20aab3d805b2b3">* The following observations on heat and cold, as they affect the animal body, may
            not be unacceptable to those who have not paid particular attention to the subject.
         </p>
         <p id="xw20aab3d805b2b5">The living body (not like the dead one, which assumes the temperature of the surrounding
            atmosphere) maintains within itself a steady heat of about 96Â°. of Fareheit's thermometer,
            varying little with the ordinary variations of the atmosphere. this heat is principally
            supplied by respiration. the vital air, or oxygen of the atmospheric fluid inhaled,
            is separated by the lungs from the azotic &amp; carbonic parts, and is absorbed by them;
            the caloric is disengaged, diffused thro' the mass of the body, and absorbed from
            the skin by the external air coming into contact with it. if the external air is of
            a high temperature, it does not take up the superfluous heat of the body fast enough,
            and we complain of too much heat: if it is very cold, it absorbs the heat too fast,
            &amp; produces the sensation of cold. to remedy this, we interpose a covering, which acting
            as a strainer, lets less air come into contact with the body, and checks the escape
            of the vital heat. as the atmospheric air becomes colder, more or thicker coverings
            are used, till no more than the requisite portion of heat is conducted from the body.
            as it would be inconvenient in the day to be burthened with a mass of clothing entirely
            equivalent to great degrees of cold, we have resort to fires and warm rooms to correct
            the state of the atmosphere, as a supplement to our clothing. if we have not the opportunity,
            and the cold is excessive, the thinner parts, as the ear, the nose, the fingers and
            toes lose heat till they freeze, and, if the cold be sufficient, the whole body is
            reduced in heat, till death ensues: as sailors experience who escape from shipwreck,
            in winter storms, on desert shores, where no fire can be found.
