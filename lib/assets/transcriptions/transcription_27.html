               part of the Kanhaway may be turned into the South fork of the Roanoke, the Allegany
               there subsiding, and the two rivers approaching so near, that a canal of 9. miles
               long. and of 30. feet depth, at the deepest part, would draw the water of the Kanhaway
               into this branch of the Roanoke. this canal would be in Montgomery county, the courthouse
               of which is on the top of the Allegany.

      <div id="xw20aab3d117b7" class="addDescription"> All additions are in ink and in Jefferson's hand. These revisions are made to the
         paragraph on The Great Kanhaway. The first phrase is inserted by means of a caret
         that splits the two words "James river" and adds an "s", which pluralizes the printed
         word "river" and writes over the period that had punctuated the sentence. Throughout
         his personal copy, as here, Jefferson mixes his typographic handwriting with the printed
         page. The longer annotation begins at the end of the paragraph and then reappears
         in the left margin, finally spilling into the bottom margin.</div>
