      to contemporary developments in chemistry. The + numbered (3) is in pencil. All the
      other additions are in ink. The addition numbered (8) appears to capture the "This"
      from the printed text, completing a new sentence. Striking out the "with" and changing
      the singular verb to plural in the next line suggests a new complete sentence.</div>
