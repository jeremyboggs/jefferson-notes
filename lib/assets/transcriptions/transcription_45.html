      <p id="xw20aab3d179a" class="first">A small slip is pasted onto a trapezoidal stub. In ink, Jefferson transcribes the
         printed text from the 1787 printed edition up until "a violent head-ach," (The hand
         employed here, extremely neat and tiny, may produce a headache in some readers.) A
         caret, in pencil, is matched by a second caret following "the fissure," and echoed
         in the printed text in a corresponding position. Jefferson continues, "this painful
         sensation [...]". He scratches out and corrects three words, inserting "three eights
         of a mile."
      </p>
      <p id="xw20aab3d179b2">On page 35, visible in the scan, a pencil crosses out "If the view from the top be
         pain-" and the cancellation continues on page 36, where the strike through ends at
         "equal extreme." A strike-through, in pencil, cancels twelve lines, ending and bracketed
         at the phrase "about five miles." Jefferson's revision corrects an inaccuracy of memory,
         described on the leaf's verso. Compare the 1853 edition, which includes different
         language: <blockquote>and descending then to the valley below, the sensation becomes delightful in the extreme.
      It is impossible for the emotions arising from the sublime to be felt beyond what
      they are here: so beautiful an arch, so elevated, so light, and springing as it were
      up to heaven, the rapture of the spectator is really indescribable. The fissure continues
      deep and narrow, and following the margin of the stream upwards, about three-eights
      of a mile, you arrive at a limestone cavern, less remarkable for the height and extent
      than those before described. Its entrance into the hill is but a few feet above the
      bed of the stream. This bridge is in the county of Rockbridge, to which it has given
      name, and affords a public and commodious passage over a valley, which cannot be crossed
      elsewhere for a considerable distance. The stream passing under it is called Cedar
      Creek. It is a water of James River, and sufficient in the dryest seasons to turn
      a grist mill, though its fountain is not more than two miles above.</blockquote></p></div>
