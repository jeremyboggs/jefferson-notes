      <div id="xw20aab3d799b4" class="addDescription">At the end of the short paragraph beginning "Our changes from heat to cold," Jefferson
         inserts a colon, in ink, and lengthens the sentence. After following the printed line,
         this addition spills into the left margin. We wonder if Jefferson is struck by
         the numerology of 1774, 1784, and July 4, making the radical swing in
         temperature portentous of something more than meteorology. </div>
