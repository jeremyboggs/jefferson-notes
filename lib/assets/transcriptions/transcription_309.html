      <p id="xw20aab3e1302b1">It is true, we find no trace either in English or American history, that these were
         the views which determined the relations existing between our weights, measures and
         monies. but it is more difficult to conceive that such a series of combinations should
         have been merely accidental, than that History should have been silent
         about them.
      </p>
      <p id="xw20aab3e1302b3">I am aware that there are differences of opinion as to the antient weights &amp; coins.
         those here stated are taken from Brerewood,
         Kennet, Ainsworth &amp; the Encylopedie; &amp; are as likely to have prevailed with our ancestors
         as the opinions opposed to them."
