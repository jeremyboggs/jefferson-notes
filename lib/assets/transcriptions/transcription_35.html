         <p id="xw20aab3d153b9b1">Both manuscript additions are in pencil. The ratio appears in the lower left margin;
            the plus appears in the fifth line from the bottom of the page just before the sentence
            beginning "But the courses of the great..." The 1853 edition, printed in Richmond,
            breaks this text across pages 16 and 17 thus: "... But the | courses of the great
            ..." And in that new edition, a number 2, the first signature (a printed mark that
            aids the binder in arranging loose printed sheets in correct order), appears on page
            17.

         <p id="xw20aab3d153b9b3">In the hand-press period multiple pages were often imposed on both sides of a single
            large sheet of paper. These sheets were later folded into groups of leaves or gatherings.
            The 1787 printing is in quarto (abbreviated 4ยบ): four pages are printed on each side
            of a sheet that is folded twice. The 1853 printing, an octavo edition (abbreviated
            8ยบ), imposed eight pages on each side of the original sheet, which was then folded
            three times. The complete octavo edition of 1853 is constructed of 18 gatherings,
            the first 15 of which incorporate the text of the 1787 printing and Jefferson's additions.

         <p id="xw20aab3d153b9b5">These pencilled marks, numbers, and instructions described here provide fascinating
            evidence of how Jefferson's personal copy was employed in the 1853 edition published
            by J. W. Randolph in Richmond. The ratio, one of twelve pencilled in the margins of
            Jefferson's personal copy, is involved in the typesetting of the new edition. It associates
            text in Jefferson's personal copy with a page number and the signature of a gathering
            in the new 1853 edition. Other ratios appear on pages 48, 73, 99, 170, 195, 222, 249,
            275, 195, 325, and 385 of Jefferson's personal copy. The complete series of ratios
            is 17/2, 33/3, 49/4, 65/5, 113/8, 129/9, 145/10, 161/11, 177/12, 193/13, 209/14, 210/15.
            The last of these may be a mistake: the 15th gathering begins with page 225, not 210.
            Note also, the expected ratios 81/6 and 97/7 do not appear in personal copy. We conjecture
            that it may have been  difficult for the printers to predict how these pages, filled
            with tables, would be laid out in the new edition
