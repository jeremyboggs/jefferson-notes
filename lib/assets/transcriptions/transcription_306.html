                  with the Greek &amp; Roman monies is so singular as to be worthy notice &amp; to found suspicion
                  that this object may have had some influence in fixing our monies at this particular
                  point, at a time when the value of Greek &amp; Roman learning was more justly estimated
                  than at this day. The Penny lawful is precisely the Roman as, which was their unit,
