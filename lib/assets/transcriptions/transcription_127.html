      <p id="xw20aab3d718b1">Jefferson recruits the "I" at the bottom of the page in order to sign, surreptitiously,
         his personal copy of the <i id="xw20aab3d718b1b1">Notes</i>. The printed mark so recruited, a standard mark in printed books from the hand-press
         period, was a useful guide for compositors and binders during the imposition of the
         text and gathering and folding of the printed sheets. In the eighteenth century most
         books were not printed one leaf at time, rather large sheets were printed with a number
         of pages on each side and folded into a "quire" or "gathering." The 1787 edition of
         the <i id="xw20aab3d718b1b3">Notes</i> is printed in quarto, that is, the printed sheet is folded twice with four pages
         printed on each side.
      </p> 
      <p id="xw20aab3d718b3">Because the printer's mark is traditionally known as a "signature," when Jefferson
         draws the letter "T." in front of the printed signature "I" (a letter indistinguishable
         from "J" in the  Roman alphabet of 23 letters, which omits J, U, and W), he is, as
         it were, signing the signature. A happy accident finds the I signature at the bottom
         of a page which includes a taxonomy of the "Birds of Virginia." See also page 273
         of this edition, where Jefferson has similarly initialed, placing an "I." after the
         T signature.
