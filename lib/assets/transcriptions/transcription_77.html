            Plinio escrive aver venido a Italia de la India diez años avia, quando escrivio, tiene
            alguna similitud con el mayz, en lo que dize que es grano, y que nace en caña, y se
            cubre de hoja, y que tiene al remate como cabellos, y el ser fertilissimo, todo lo
            qual no quadra con el Mijo, que comunmente entienden por Milio, en fin, repartio el
            Criador a todas partes su govierne: a este orbe dio el triga que es el principal sustento
            de los hombres: a aquel de Indias dio el mayz, que tras el trigo tiene el segundo
            lugar, para sustenta de hombres, y animales. Acosta. 4.16.

      <p id="xw20aab3d626a" class="first">The manuscript addition appears in the bottom margin. The translation by Maximilian
         Schele de Vere is as follows:
      </p> 
      "The maize came from America to Spain, and thence to other European countries." "The
      Spaniards in Europe and in America call the maize <i id="xw20aab3d626b2b1">maiz</i>, a word derived from the language of Hayti, which was spoken in the island now called
      Hispaniola, or St. Domingo." &#8212; 1. Clavigero, 56. "Maize, a grain granted by Providence
      to that portion of the globe, instead of the wheat of Europe, the rice of Asia, and
      the millet of Africa." &#8212; 2. Clavig., 218. Acosta classes Indian corn with the plants
      peculiar to America, observing that it is called "Trigo de las Indias" (Indian wheat)
      in Spain, and "Grano de - Turquia" (Turkey grain) in Italy. He says, "From hence came
      Indian corn, and why they call this most productive grain in Italian, Turkey grain,
      is more easily asked than answered. Because, in fact, there is no trace of such a
      plant in the old world, although the millet, which Pliny says came ten years before
      he wrote from India to Italy, has some resemblance to maize, inasmuch as he calls
      it a grain, which grows in stalks, and is covered with leaves, which has at the top
      a kind of hair, and is remarkably productive&#8212;all of which does not apply to mijo,
      by which they commonly mean millet. After all, the Creator rules all parts of the
      globe: to one he gave wheat, the principal food of man; to the Indias he gave maize,
      which holds the second place, next to wheat, as a food for man and beast."&#8212; Acosta,
      iv., 16."</div>
