               is not a trace of it in the other parts of the languages. when a tribe has gone farther
               than it's neighbors in inventing a system of numeration, the obvious utility of this
               will occasion it to be immediately adopted by the surrounding tribes with only such
               modifications of the sound as may accommodate them to the habitual pronunciations
               of their own languages.

         corner a pencilled circle appears. See previous the transcription for corresponding
         in-text marking. In pencil at the top of the strip appears the instruction "p. 164.

         slip, apparently in a different hand. Jefferson's manuscript addition, in ink appears
         on the slip below and is incorporated into the main text of the 1853 edition.</div>
