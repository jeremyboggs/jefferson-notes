               <p id="xw20aab3d805c13b1b1b1">Of the substances we use for covering, linen seems the openest strainer for admission
                  of air to the body, and the most copious conductor of heat from it; and is therefore
                  considered as a cool clothing. cotton obstructs still more the passage of both fluids;
                  and wool more than cotton: it is called therefore a worse conductor of heat, and warmer
                  clothing. next to this are the furs, and the most impermeable of all for heat and
                  air are feathers and down, and especially the down of the Eider duck. (Anas mollissima.)
                  hence the insensibility to cold of the beasts with shaggy hair, or fine fur, and of
                  the birds in proportion as they are provided with down and soft feathers, as the swan,
                  goose, and duck.

               <p id="xw20aab3d805c13b1b1b3">Among the substances which, as being bad conductors of heat, foment and warm the animal
                  body, are the leaves of the Espeletia Frailexon, a plant newly discovered by the great
                  naturalist and traveller Baron Humboldt, on the mountains of S. America, at the height
                  of 2450. toises above the sea. these leaves being furnished abundantly with a soft
                  down, restore immediately to their due warmth the hands, feet, or other members benumbed
                  with cold; and collected as a bed, protect from death the Indian benighted in those
                  regions of extreme cold. the same scientific traveller, by analysis of the air, at
                  different heights on the mountain of Chimborazo which he ascended to the height of
                  3036 toises (546 toises higher than had ever been done by man before, and within 224
                  toises of it's top) found that the oxygen being specifically heavier than the azotic
                  part of the atmosphere, it's proportion lessened in that ascent 27. or 28. to 19Â½
                  hundredth parts. The same circumstance had been before observed by Saussure, Pini
                  &amp; Rebout on the high mountains of Europe, and must be among the principal causes of
                  the degree in which the animal body is affected with cold in situations more or less
                  elevated.
