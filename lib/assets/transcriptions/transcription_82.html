               M. de Buffon considers the existence of Elephant bones in Northern regions, where
               the animal itself is no longer found, as one of the leading facts which support his
               theory that the earth was once in a liquid state, rendered so by the action of fire,
               that the process of cooling began at its poles, and proceeded gradually towards the
               torrid zone, that with this progress the animals of warm temperature retired towards
               the equator, and that in the present state of that progress the globe remains of sufficient
               warmth, for the elephant for instance, in the tropical regions, only to which therefore
               they have retired, as their last asylum and where they must become extinct when the
               degree of warmth shall be reduced below that adapted to their constitution. how does
               it happen then that no elephants exist at present in the tropical regions of America,
               to which those of the Ohio must have retired, according to this theory.

      <div id="xw20aab3d634c25" class="addDescription"> A tipped-in leaf is glued to trapezoidal stub. The passage is written in ink on the
         recto of the slip (the verso is blank). The printed line to which the manuscript addition
         is to be subjoined is visible in the scan on the page behind (page 69). A pencilled
         + in the printed text follows "habitation for the elephant." (This mark is not again
         accounted for in our separate transcription of page 69.) The corresponding pencilled
         x appears on the leaf just before "M. de Buffon considers". Two long strike-throughs
         display Jefferson in the act of composition: first, after, "by the action of fire,
         reads and that as it cooled, the animals of warm temperature and the second, after "the present state of that progress", reads there does not remain warmth. Three more shorter deletions follow. Markings (2) and (3) are in pencil.</div>
