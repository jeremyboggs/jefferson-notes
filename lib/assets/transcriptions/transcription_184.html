               <p id="xw20aab3d934b2b1b3b1">In the Notes on Virgi. the great diversity of languages appearing 
                  radically different which are spoken by the red men of America, is <del>considered as</del>
                  supposed to authorize a supposition that <del>they have inhabited their country longer than</del> their 
                  settlement is more remote than that of Asia by it's red inhabitants. but it
                  must be confessed that the mind finds it difficult to concieve that so many tribes
                  have inhabited it from so remote an antiquity as would be necessary to have divided <!--caret insertion: them-->
                  them into language so radically different. I will therefore hazard a conjecture,
                  as such, and only to be estimated at what it may be worth. we know that the Indians
                  consider it as dishonorable to use any language but their own. hence in their councils
                  with us, though some of them may have been in situations which from convenience or
                  necessity have obliged them to learn our language well, yet they refuse to confer
                  in it, &amp; always insist on the intervention of <!--caret insertion: an--> an interpreter, 
                  tho he <!--caret insertion: may--> may understand 
                  neither language so well as themselves: &amp; this fact is as general
                  as our knowledge of the tribes of N. America. when therefore a fraction of a tribe
                  from domestic feuds had broken off from it's main body <del>&amp; gone to another</del> to which it is 
                  held by no law or compact, &amp; has gone to another settlement, may it
                  not be the point of honor with them <!--deletion" illegible"--> not to use the language of those <del>from</del><!--insertion: with--> with whom 
                  they have quarreled, but to have one of their own. they have use but for
                  few words, &amp; possess but few. it would require but a small effort of the mind to invent
                  these and to acquire the habit of using them. perhaps this hypothesis presents less
                  difficulty than that of so many radically distinct languages preserved by such handfuls
                  of men, from an antiquity so remote that no data we possess will enable us to calculate
                  it.
