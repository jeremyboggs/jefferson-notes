               <p id="xw20aab3e1292b9b1b1b1">1/24 more than the Attic drachm, contrary to the testimony of antiquity that the Denarius
                  and the Drachm were equal. we may very probably conjecture that our Troy weight is
                  taken from the Grecians, from whom our Physicians derive their science &amp;, in copying
                  their recipes, would of course preserve their weights which fix the quantum &amp; proportion
                  of ingredients. We may as probably affirm that our Avoirdupois weight is taken from
                  the Romans, from whom through their colonies &amp; conquests in France, Spain, Germany,
                  Britain we derive our Agriculture &amp; Commerce. accordingly we observe that while we
                  weigh our physic by the Troy or Grecian weights, we use the Avoirdupois or Roman
                  for the productions of agriculture &amp; general articles of Commerce. and since Antiquity
                  affirms that these two series were united by the equality of the Drachm &amp; Denarius,
                  we must conclude that in progress of time, they have become a little separated in
                  use with us, to wit 1/24 part as before noted.
               </p>
               <p id="xw20aab3e1292b9b1b1b3">But the point at which their separation has been arrested, and fixed is a very remarkable
                  one. 1000 ounces avoirdupois make exactly a cubic foot of water. this integral, decimal,
                  &amp; cubical relation induces a presumption that while deciding among the varieties &amp;
                  uncertainties which, during the ruder ages of the arts, we know had crept into the
                  weights &amp; measures of England, they had adopted for their standard those which stood
                  so conveniently connected through the medium of a natural element, always at hand
                  to be appealed to.
               </p>
               <p id="xw20aab3e1292b9b1b1b5">The ounce avoirdupois being this fixed at the thousandth part of a cubic foot of water,
                  the Winchester bushel, of 2150.4 cubic inches, filled with water, would weight 77.7
                  lb avoirdupois,

         third line of the second paragraph, "ounces" is written over an illegible word that
         has been crossed out, with a caret underneath; and in the first line of third paragraph
         "avoirdupois" is inserted between "ounce" and "being".</div>
