            <li id="xw20aab3d316b2b1b1">We are told that during a great storm on the 25<i id="xw20aab3d316b2b1b1b1">th</i>. of Dec. 1798. the Syphon fountain, near the mouth of the North Holston ceased, and
               a spring broke out about 100. feet higher up the hill. Syphon fountains have been
               explained by supposing the duct which leads from the reservoir to the surface of the
               earth to be in the form of a syphon a. b. c. where it is evident that till the water
               rises in the reservoir to d the level of the highest point of the syphon, it cannot
               flow through the duct, &amp; it is known that when once it begins to flow it will draw
               off the water of the reservoir to the orifice a. of the syphon if the duct be larger
               than the supply of the reservoir. possibly the force of the waters &amp; loosening of
               the earth by them, during the storm abovementioned may have opened a more direct duct
               as from e. to f. horizontally or declining, which issued higher up the hill than the
               one fed by the syphon. In that case it becomes a common spring. should this duct be
               again closed or diminished by any new accident the syphon may begin to play again,
               and both springs be kept in action from the same reservoir.
