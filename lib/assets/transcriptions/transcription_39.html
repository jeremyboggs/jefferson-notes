      <div id="xw20aab3d153c48" class="addDescription"> The margin note, in ink, is located in the center of the right margin. Jefferson
         may have originally tried to interlineate his manuscript text, could not fit it, and
         scratched out the annotation: some of the neighboring printed text has been erased
         and re-inked. "Epoq." is an abbreviation of Buffon's <i id="xw20aab3d153c48b1">Époques de la nature</i> (<i id="xw20aab3d153c48b3">Epochs of Nature</i>), a widely-read multivolume natural history. As Buffon was an important interlocutor
         for Jefferson, citations of his work appear throughout the <i id="xw20aab3d153c48b5">Notes</i>; in fact, a copy of the <i id="xw20aab3d153c48b7">Notes</i> was presented to Buffon by Jefferson in 1787. At the bottom of the page the residue
         of a red seal (originally attached to the opposite tipped-in leaf) has stuck to the
         surface of the paper.</div>
