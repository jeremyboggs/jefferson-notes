         text which appears in the last paragraph of Query IV; the mark follows "deemed Pumice."
         The next addition is marked with a "phi" [&#934;] in pencil; its corresponding, smudged
         annotation appears in the bottom margin, also in pencil. It is a reference to map
         1 in Appendix IV. The fifth annotation, marked with an asterisk appears in the text,
         follows "in this." The corresponding note appears in the left margin. In the text
         Jefferson has struck in ink through "into" replacing it with "from." In the bottom
         margin, in pencil, is a reference to map no. 1, already described.</div>
