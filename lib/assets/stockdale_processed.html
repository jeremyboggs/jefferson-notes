  <p id="xw20aab3b7"><i id="xw20aab3b7a">THE</i> following Notes were written in Virginia in
  the year 1781, and somewhat corrected and enlarged in the winter of 1782, in answer to
  Queries proposed to the Author, by a Foreigner of Distinction, <img

    id="xw20aab3b7b2" class="addEditorial">Jefferson is referring to François
    Barbé-Marbois (1745-1837), who was secretary to the French legation to the early
    United States. In 1780, Marbois gave a questionnaire to representatives of each of
    the thirteen states so that he could produce a report on the new nation. The
    questionnaire for Virginia was passed on to Jefferson, who took on the project of
    answering Marbois's queries; <i id="xw20aab3b7b2b1">Notes on the State of Virginia
    </i> is, ultimately, the product. In 1803, when Jefferson was President, Marbois
    negotiated the Louisiana Purchase with him.</span> then residing among us. The
  subjects are all treated imperfectly; some scarcely touched on. To apologize for this by
  developing the circumstances of the time and place of their composition, would be to
  open wounds which have already bled enough. To these circumstances some of their
  imperfections may with truth be ascribed; the great mass to the want of information and
  want of talents in the writer. He had a few copies printed, <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3b7b4" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3b7b4" class="addEditorial">In 1785, Jefferson had a private edition of
    200 copies of <i id="xw20aab3b7b4b1">Notes on the State of Virginia </i>printed in
    Paris; one of the copies of that printing has been digitized for this edition.
    Another copy was obtained by a French bookseller, who issued a translation of the
    work into French; unhappy with errors that had crept into the text, and worried that
    the book would now be translated back into English (with, very likely, more errors
    produced in that process), Jefferson approached the London publisher John Stockdale
    to issue a new, English edition. Page images of Jefferson&#8217;s own copy of the
    1787 London edition, which was extensively annotated and amended by him in later
    years, are also included in this edition.</span> which he gave among his friends:
  and a translation of them has been lately published in France, but with such alterations
  as the laws of the press in that country rendered necessary. They are now offered to the
  public in their original form and language. </p>

  <p id="xw20aab3c23"><i id="xw20aab3c23a">AN</i> exact description of the limits and Limits,
  boundaries of the state of Virginia ? </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c25">Virginia is bounded on the East by the Atlantic: on the North by a line
  of latitude, crossing the Eastern Shore through Watkins's Point, being about 37°. 57'.
  North latitude; from thence by a streight line to Cinquac, near the mouth of Patowmac;
  thence by the Patowmac, which is common to Virginia and Maryland, to the first fountain
  of its northern branch; thence by a meridian line, passing through that fountain till it
  intersects a line running East and West, in latitude 390°. 43', 42.4" which divides
  Maryland from Pennsylvania, and which was marked by Messrs. Mason and Dixon <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b1" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3c25b1" class="addEditorial">Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon had drawn
    the boundary between Maryland and Virginia in the 1760s, creating the famous
    "Mason-Dixon" line that would distinguish North from South by the time of the Civil
    War.</span>; thence by that line, and a continuation of it westwardly to the
  completion of five degrees of longitude from the eastern boundary of Pennsylvania, in
  the same latitude, and thence by a meridian line to the Ohio: On the West by the Ohio
  and Missisipi, to latitude 36°. 30'. North : and on the South by the line of latitude
  last-</p>

<div id="2" class="page">
  <p> mentioned. By admeasurements
  through nearly the whole of this last line, and supplying the unmeasured parts from good
  data, the Atlantic and Missisipi, are found in this latitude to be 758 miles distant,
  equal to 13°. 38'. of longitude, reckoning 55 miles and 3144 feet to the degree. This
  being our comprehension of longitude, that of our latitude, taken between this and Mason
  and Dixon's line, is 3°. 13'. 42.4". equal to 223.3 miles, supposing a degree of a great
  circle to be 69 m. 864 f. as computed by Cassini <img id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b5"
  class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span id="xw20aab3c25b5"
    class="addEditorial">Jacques Cassini (1677-1756) had calculated the precise distance
    of a degree of latitude.</span>. These boundaries include an area somewhat
  triangular, of 121525 square miles, whereof 79650 lie westward of the Allegany
  mountains, and 57034 westward of the meridian of the mouth of the Great Kanhaway <img
  id="editorial-xw20aab3c25b7" class="editorialTrigger" src="editorial.png" /><span
    id="xw20aab3c25b7" class="addEditorial">Now more commonly known as the New
    River.</span>. This state is therefore one third larger than the islands of Great
  Britain and Ireland, which are reckoned at 88357 square miles. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c27">These limits result from, 1. The antient charters from the crown of
  England. 2. The grant of Maryland to the Lord Baltimore, and the subsequent
  determinations of the British court as to the extent of that grant. 3. The grant of
  Pennsylvania to William Penn, and a compact between the general assemblies of the
  commonwealths of Virginia and Pennsylvania as to the extent of that grant. 4. The grant
  of Carolina, and</p>
</div>

<div id="3" class="page">
  <p>actual location of its
  northern boundary, by consent of both parties. 5. The treaty of Paris of 1763. 6. The
  confirmation of the charters of the neighbouring states by the convention of Virginia at
  the time of constituting their commonwealth. 7. The cession made by Virginia to Congress
  of all the lands to which they had title on the North side of the Ohio. </p>

  <div id="xw20aab3c31" class="marginNote">Rivers and Navigation.</div>
  <p id="xw20aab3c33"><i id="xw20aab3c33a">A NOTICE</i> of its rivers, rivulets, and Rivers
  and navigation and how far they are navigable? </p> An inspection of a map of Virginia,
  will give a better idea of the geography of its rivers, than any description in writing.
  Their navigation may be imperfectly noted. <p id="xw20aab3c35">
  <i id="xw20aab3c35a">Roanoke</i>, so far as it lies within this state, is no where
  navigable, but for canoes, or light batteaux; and, even for these, in such detached
  parcels as to have prevented the inhabitants from availing themselves of it at all. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c37"><i id="xw20aab3c37a">James River</i>, and its waters, afford navigation
  as follows. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c39">The whole of Elizabeth River, the lowest of those which run into James
  River, is a harbour, and would contain upwards of 300</p>
  </p>
</div>

<div id="4" class="page">
  <p>ships. The channel is from 150 to 200 fathom wide, and at common flood
  tide, affords 18 feet water to Norfolk. The Strafford, a 60 gun ship, went there,
  lightening herself to cross the bar at Sowell's point. The Fier Rodrigue, pierced for 64
  guns, and carrying 50, went there without lightening. Craney island, at the mouth of
  this river, commands its channel tolerably well. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c41"><i id="xw20aab3c41a">Nansemond River</i> is navigable to Sleepy hole,
  for vessels of 250 tons; to Suffolk, for those of 100 tons; and to Milner's, for those
  of 25. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c43"><i id="xw20aab3c43a">Pagan Creek</i> affords 8 or 10 feet water to
  Smithfeild, which admits vessels of 20 ton. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c45"><i id="xw20aab3c45a">Chickahominy</i> has at its mouth a bar, on which
  is only 12 feet water at common flood tide. Vessels passing that, may go 8 miles up the
  river; those of 10 feet draught may go four miles further, and those of six tons
  burthen, 20 miles further. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c47"><i id="xw20aab3c47a">Appamattox</i> may be navigated as far as
  Broadways, by any vessel which has crossed Harrison's bar in James river; it keeps 8 or
  9 feet water a mile or two higher up to Fisher's bar, and 4 feet on that and upwards to
  Petersburgh, where all navigation ceases. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c49"><i id="xw20aab3c49a">James River</i> itself affords harbour for vessels
  of any size in Hampton Road, but not in safety through the whole winter; and
  </p>
</div>

<div id="5" class="page">
  <p>there is navigable water for them as far as
  Mulberry island. A 40 gun ship goes to James town, and, lightening herself, may pass to
  Harrison's bar, on which there is only 15 feet water. Vessels of 250 tons may go to
  Warwick; those of 125 go to Rocket's, a mile below Richmond; from thence is about 7 feet
  water to Richmond; and about the center of the town, four feet and a half, where the
  navigation is interrupted by falls, which in a course of six miles, descend about 80
  feet perpendicular: above these it is resumed in canoes and batteaux, and is prosecuted
  safely and advantageously to within 10 miles of the Blue ridge; and even through the
  Blue ridge a ton weight has been brought; and the expence would not be great, when
  compared with its object, to open a tolerable navigation up Jackson's river and
  Carpenter's creek, to within 25 miles of Howard's creek of Green briar, both of which
  have then water enough to float vessels into the Great Kanhaway. In some future state of
  population, I think it possible, that its navigation may also be made to interlock with
  that of the Patowmac, and through that to communicate by a short portage with the Ohio.
  It is to be noted, that this river is called in the maps <i id="xw20aab3c49b4">James
    River</i>, only to its confluence with the Rivanna; thence to the</p>
</div>

<div id="6" class="page">
  <p>Blue ridge it is called the Fluvanna; and thence to its
  source, Jackson's river. But in common speech, it is called James river to its source. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c51">The <i id="xw20aab3c51b1">Rivanna</i>, a branch of James river, is
  navigable for canoes and batteaux to its intersection with the South West mountains,
  which is about 22 miles; and may easily be opened to navigation through those mountains
  to its fork above Charlottesville. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c53"><i id="xw20aab3c53a">York River</i>, at York town, affords the best
  harbour in the state for vessels of the largest size. The river there narrows to the
  width of a mile, and is contained within very high banks, close under which the vessels
  may ride. It holds 4 fathom water at high tide for 25 miles above York to the mouth of
  Poropotank, where the river is a mile and a half wide, and the channel only 75 fathom,
  and passing under a high bank. At the confluence of <i id="xw20aab3c53b2">Pamunkey</i>
  and <i id="xw20aab3c53b4">Mattapony</i>, it is reduced to 3 fathom depth, which
  continues up Pamunkey to Cumberland, where the width is 100 yards, and up Mattapony to
  within two miles of Frazer's ferry, where it becomes 2½ fathom deep, and holds that
  about five miles. Pamunkey is then capable of navigation for loaded flats to Brockman's
  bridge, 50 miles above Hanover town,</p>
</div>

<div id="7" class="page">
  <p>and
  Mattapony to Downer's bridge, 70 miles above its mouth. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c55"><i id="xw20aab3c55a">Piankatank</i>, the little rivers making out of <i
    id="xw20aab3c55b2">Mobjack bay</i> and those of the <i id="xw20aab3c55b4">Eastern
    Shore</i>, receive only very small vessels, and these can but enter them. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c57"><i id="xw20aab3c57a">Rappahanock</i> affords 4 fathom water to Hobb's
  hole, and 2 fathom from thence to Fredericksburg. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c59"><i id="xw20aab3c59a">Patowmac</i> is 7½ miles wide at the mouth ; 4½ at
  Nomony bay; 3 at Aquia; 1½ at Hallooing point; 1¼ at Alexandria. Its soundings are, 7
  fathom at the mouth; 5 at St. George's island; 4½ at Lower Matchodic ; 3 at Swan's
  point, and thence up to Alexandria; thence 10 feet water to the falls, which are 13
  miles above Alexandria. These falls are 15 miles in length, and of very great descent,
  and the navigation above them for batteaux and canoes, is so much interrupted as to be
  little used. It is, however, used in a small degree up the Cohongoronta branch as far as
  Fort Cumberland, which was at the mouth of Wills's creek: and is capable, at no great
  expence, of being rendered very practicable. The Shenandoah branch interlocks with James
  river about the Blue ridge, and may perhaps in future be opened. </p>
</div>

<div id="8" class="page">
  <p id="xw20aab3c63">The <i id="xw20aab3c63b1">Missisipi</i> will be one of the principal
  channels of future commerce for the country westward of the Alleghaney. From the mouth
  of this river to where it receives the Ohio, is 1000 miles by water, but only 500 by
  land, passing through the Chickasaw country. From the mouth of the Ohio to that of the
  Missouri, is 230 miles by water, and 140 by land. From thence to the mouth of the
  Illinois river, is about 25 miles. The Missisipi, below the mouth of the Missouri, is
  always muddy, and abounding with sand bars, which frequently change their places.
  However, it carries 15 feet water to the mouth of the Ohio, to which place it is from
  one and a half to two miles wide, and thence to Kaskaskia from one mile to a mile and a
  quarter wide. Its current is so rapid, that it never can be stemmed by the force of the
  wind alone, acting on sails. Any vessel, however, navigated with oars, may come up at
  any time, and receive much aid from the wind. A batteaux passes from the mouth of Ohio
  to the mouth of Missisipi in three weeks, and is from two to three months getting up
  again. During its floods, which are periodical as those of the Nile, the largest vessels
  may pass down it, if their steerage can be ensured. These floods begin in April, and the
  river returns into its banks</p>
</div>

<div id="9" class="page">
  <p>early in
  August. The inundation extends further on the western than eastern side, covering the
  lands in some places for 50 miles from its banks. Above the mouth of the Missouri, it
  becomes much such a river as the Ohio, like it clear; and gentle in its current, not
  quite so wide, the period of its floods nearly the same, but not rising to so great a
  height. The streets of the village at Cohoes are not more than 10 feet above the
  ordinary level of the water, and yet were never overflowed. Its bed deepens every year.
  Cohoes, in the memory of many people now living, was insulated by every flood of the
  river. What was the Eastern channel has now become a lake, 9 miles in length and one in
  width, into which the river at this day never flows. This river yields turtle of a
  peculiar kind, perch, trout, gar, pike, mullets, herrings, carp, spatula fish <img

  abounds in herons, cranes, ducks, brant, geese, and swans. Its passage is commanded by a
  fort established by this state, five miles below the mouth of Ohio, and ten miles above
  the Carolina boundary. </p>
</div>

<div id="10" class="page">
  <p id="xw20aab3c67">The Missouri, since the treaty of Paris, the Illinois and Northern
  branches of the Ohio since the cession to Congress, are no longer within our limits. Yet
  having been so heretofore, and still opening to us channels of extensive communication
  with the western and north-western country, they shall be noted in their order. </p>
  <p id="xw20aab3c69">The <i id="xw20aab3c69b1">Missouri</i> is, in fact, the principal river,
  contributing more to the common stream than does the Missisipi, even after its junction
  with the Illinois. It is remarkably cold, muddy and rapid. Its overflowings are
  considerable. They happen during the months of June and July. Their commencement being
  so much later than those of the Missisipi, would induce a belief that the sources of the
  Missouri are northward of those of the Missisipi, unless we suppose that the cold
  increases again with the ascent of the land from the Missisipi westwardly. That this
  ascent is great, is proved by the rapidity of the river. Six miles above the mouth it is
  brought within the compass of a quarter of a mile's width: yet the Spanish Merchants at
